State of Grace (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

And I never (I never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never (Never)
Be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (Never) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Saw you comin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
And I'll never (Never) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Be the same (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real
And I never (Never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same, oh

And I never (Never) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Saw you comin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
And I'll never (Never) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong)
(We learn to live with the pain)
Be the same (Mosaic broken hearts) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(But this love is brave and wild) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right25EmbedRed (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
But loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red

(Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red)
Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah
(Red, red)

His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street20EmbedTreacherous (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I—
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it23EmbedI Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were troublе when you walked in
So shame on mе now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see-e-e-e-e

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Yeah, trouble)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah, oh-oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble23EmbedAll Too Well (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well17Embed22 (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you

But I'll bet you want to
Everything will bе alright if
We just keep dancin' like we'rе

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleepin'

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

I bet this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don’t
I almost do
I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams, you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do
I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I hope
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me17EmbedWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I remember when we broke up
The first time, saying, "This is it, I've had enough"
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change"
"Trust me," remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never, evеr, ever getting back togеther
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, "Never say never"
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever

(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh)
Getting back together (Yeah)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together11EmbedStay Stay Stay (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, "Okay, let's talk"
And I said
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
(Ha-ha-ha, that's so fun)16EmbedThe Last Time (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say, "It's been you all along"
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I'm asking you this (This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list (Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why (This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart)
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this20EmbedHoly Ground (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
Wе block the noise with the sound of "I need you"
And for thе first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you16EmbedSad Beautiful Tragic (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
Long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me
'Cause wе had a beautiful, magic love therе
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Whoa, oh, whoa, oh

Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us, we can't get back

A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair16EmbedThe Lucky One (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh17EmbedEverything Has Changed (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
(You good to go?)

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simplе name
Everything has changed
All I know is you hеld the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
Takin' flight, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
All I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed10EmbedStarlight (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing whеn we walked in
The night wе snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?7EmbedBegin Again (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wеdnesday in a café, I watched it begin again

You said you nеver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again


And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

On a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again12EmbedThe Moment I Knew (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But therе was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knеw

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here"

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
And that was the moment I knew11EmbedCome Back...Be Here (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, "Don't get attached"
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here14EmbedGirl At Home (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It’s kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, еverybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got mе alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn’t once been just like her
So don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you’ve got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her13EmbedState Of Grace (Acoustic Version)  Lyrics
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

And I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shadеs of wrong
We learn to live with thе pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real
And I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same, oh
Oh, I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right11EmbedRonan (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bedtime
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back12EmbedBetter Man (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin’ a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, "You know you had to do it"
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave to you my best
And we both know you can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
Yeah, yeah
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man25EmbedNothing New (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
They tell you while you're young
"Girls, go out and have your fun"
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, "She looks like she's been through it"
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room? (Ahh)
People love an ingénue (Ahh)

I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down?
And I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?
I know someday I'm gonna meet her
It's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh woah ohh, oh woah ohh, oh, oh

I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me, will you still want me
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new?46EmbedBabe (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
What about your promises, promises?
What about your promises, promises, promises? (No)

What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said, "No one else"
How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
(What about your promises, promises, promises?)

What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said, "No one else"
How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)

You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you

Since you admitted it, I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe? (Babe)

You really blew this, babe (Babe)
We ain't getting through this one, babe (Babe)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you

I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said, "No one else"
We ain't getting through this one, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said, "No one else"
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (Babe)

I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied

But now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified

'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A mеssage in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' herе, hopin' it gets to you
These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster, replaying your laughter, disaster

'Cause now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause

'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
You could be the one that I keep, and I (I)
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (At night)
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

How is it in London? (London)
Where were you while I'm wondering (Wondering)
If I'll ever see you again?
You could be the one that I love, mm-mm
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
'Cause you could be the one that I love (Yeah, yeah)
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (You can't sleep at night)
A message in a bottle is all I can do (Yeah, yeah)

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me
Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
"Why did you let her go?"
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?

Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"
I bet you think about me34EmbedForever Winter (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?"
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity

I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 3 AM, pacing
He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in"
My voice comes out begging
All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead

I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 5 AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and
Please don't go

I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren’t around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

I'll be your summer sun forever
At 3 AM, pacing
All this time I didn't know
At 5 AM, wasted
I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away"40EmbedRun (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
One, two, three, four

Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
"I'll wait for you"
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you
And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
There's been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
And I'll hold onto you while we run (And we run, and we run, and we run)

Like you'd run from the law (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Darling, let's run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run)
We can go where our eyes can take us (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Go where no one else is, run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, and we'll run24EmbedThe Very First Night (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts

But don't forget about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you

I remember the night at the hotel
I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
"Do you know how much I miss you?"

I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
"I miss you like it was the very first night"
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you29EmbedAll Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it207EmbedA Message From Taylor LyricsMusically and lyrically, Red resembled a heart-broken person
It was all over the place
A fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end
Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild
And tortured by memories past
These are the original thirty songs that were meant for Red
I love you guys4EmbedFearless (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fеarless

So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this onе-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Oh, oh
Oh-oh, yeah20EmbedFifteen (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Datin' the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
But I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors16EmbedLove Story (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Oh, oh

And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you44EmbedHey Stephen (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you (Huh)
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha-ha)
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Ah-uh, myself
Mmm-mm, I can't help myself
I can't help myself

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
Well, my mistakе, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have thе upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now17EmbedYou Belong With Me (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You bеlong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me23EmbedBreathe (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh, ooh)
I'm sorry12EmbedTell Me Why (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why
Well, you could write a book on
How to ruin someone's perfеct day
Well, I get so confused and frustratеd
Forget what I'm tryin' to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Oh)

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waiting in the cold
And you've got your sharе of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
So in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

Whoa, whoa, oh-oh, oh
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you11EmbedForever & Always (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

You didn't mean it baby
You said, "Forever and always," yeah11EmbedThe Best Day (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today8EmbedChange (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
So we've been outnumbered, raidеd, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when thе fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there’s something in your eyes says we can beat this

’Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we’ll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah7EmbedJump Then Fall (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and  jump then fall into me

'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa oh, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah12EmbedUntouchable (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
Oh, oh
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night, waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

I'm caught up in you
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh, oh-oh
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night, waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
And in the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, oh
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh14EmbedForever & Always (Piano Version)  Lyrics
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
What happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
You flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Please, back up, oh, back up
Back up, baby, back up

'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
You flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here, it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
You didn't mean it, baby

You said, "Forever and always," yeah8EmbedCome In With The Rain (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name, oh
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore8EmbedSuperstar (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right, babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Morning lonelinеss
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
Whеn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar12EmbedThe Other Side of the Door (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignorin' words that you were sayin'
Tryna make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
But what I mean is

I said, "Leave," but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you18EmbedToday Was a Fairytale (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around

Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Oh, oh, yeah, oh-oh
Today was a fairytale10EmbedYou All Over Me (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me


I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me38EmbedMr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
Mr. "Perfect face"
Mr. "Here to stay"
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
Everything was right
Mr. "I've been waitin' for you all my life"
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"

But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay
Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

Mr. "Never told me why"
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
Mr. "Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you

Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay your way to your seat
It's the best seat, in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins"
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay"
Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday"
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late"

Goodbye, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Goodbye, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery for the last time
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
You're perfectly fine
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
You said you'd never go away75EmbedWe Were Happy (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy

Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy
We were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
We were happy
Oh-oh-oh-oh
We were happy18EmbedThat’s When (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
And you watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back

And I said, "When can I-I-I come back?"
And you said, "That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"
Mm, mm

I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (Through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"

And you said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

And I said, "That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"
And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?"
And I said

"That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when it was sunny or storming
Laughing, when I was crying
And that's when you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"

That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
(That's when I miss you, that's when I want you)
That's when, when I see your face
That's when I love you, that's when16EmbedDon’t You (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy

But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this

But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

So I'll walk out of here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say we're still friends
(But I don't wanna pretend)
So if I see you again

Don't you (Don't you), don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you (Don't you) say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't (You don't) know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Don't you (Ah, ah, ah)11EmbedBye Bye Baby (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye, baby
Bye bye, baby
The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye, baby

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye bye, baby
Bye bye, baby10EmbedLove Story (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run
You'll be the princе and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Oh, oh
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come"
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you3Embed​willow Lyrics
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing

Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door

At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be

'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore
At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be

Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in46Embed​’tis the damn season Lyrics
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

So we could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

He did it
He did it

Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out
She says, "I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
(She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy

They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it

No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet

There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind

Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh, but you won't like it that way
It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

Ooh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything

Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well

Ooh, I guess I'll never know
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show

But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)

Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?

'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name

I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold49Embed​ivy Lyrics
How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours

Oh, goddamn

Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't

Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah

At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready

'Cause I fell from the pedestal

Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole

Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff

Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for

(Evermore)
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)

I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)

And I was catching my breath

And I couldn't be sure

I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite163Embed​the last great american dynasty Lyrics
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time70Embed​exile Lyrics
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you

We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed

I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me
Because I'm a mirrorball

Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so longRelated Songs81Embed​august Lyrics
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

At least I'm trying

And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least I'm trying78Embed​illicit affairs Lyrics
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself

Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say "move on," but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you

About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?

And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret

From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars

Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show

But you showed who you are, then one magical night

I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)93EmbedLover Lyrics
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my loverRelated Songs130EmbedThe Man Lyrics
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I’d be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I’d be the man
I'd be the man
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

If I was a man, then I'd be the man79EmbedThe Archer Lyrics
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)

He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows

Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
"So where we gonna go?"
I whisper in the dark
"Where we gonna go?"
I think he knows

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)

You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

It's you and me, that's my whole world

Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)

The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want61EmbedCornelia Street Lyrics
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?

’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)

Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"75EmbedLondon Boy Lyrics
We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I'd...

I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet

Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)

The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

You'll get better

We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love

I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love67EmbedYou Need To Calm Down Lyrics
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down123EmbedAfterglow Lyrics
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It’s on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go

I promise that you'll never find another like me

I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, one, two, three
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)

Ooh
Ooh

School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Light pink sky, up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)


Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
(Ooh)49EmbedDaylight Lyrics
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love59Embed...Ready for It? Lyrics
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Oh, are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)
You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?157EmbedEnd Game Lyrics
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Woah, woah, woah)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat (Boat, boat, boat)
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (That's what they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life (My life, my life)

I don't wanna touch you (I don’t wanna be)
Just another ex-love (You don’t wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don’t wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinking on a beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it’s easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just another ex-love (You don't wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinking on a beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say (Yeah)
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies, hey
Big reputation, big reputation, yeah
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

I hit you like bang
We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me
They told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go
Your handprints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor
It's like your body is gold
You've been callin' my bluff on all my usual tricks (Ooh)
So here's the truth from my red lips (Ah)

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you) (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now) (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game114EmbedI Did Something Bad Lyrics
I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da da-da

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing"
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'
They say I did something bad (Oh)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da

They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one

Light me up, go ahead and light me up (Light me up)

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacin', I just need you
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes (Echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

And baby, for you
I would (I would) fall from grace
Just to (Just to) touch your face
If you (If you) walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
('Cause I like you)
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…

Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting? (One, two, three)
And all the pieces fall (Pieces fall) right into place
Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep (Oh)
And I'm yours to lose (Baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…

Come here, dressed in black now

Scratches down your back now

Come here, dressed in black now

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can’t have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous88EmbedGetaway Car Lyrics
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)

You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin’, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin’
And I was just drinkin’
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin’, "Go, go, go!"
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We’re both sorry)
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)

Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car104EmbedKing Of My Heart Lyrics
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "Baby" like tryin' on clothes

Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)
Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once
'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once51EmbedDancing with Our Hands Tied Lyrics
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I–

Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance?
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I–

Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)58EmbedDress Lyrics
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin' about

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha...

Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I don’t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off53EmbedThis Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things Lyrics
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things54EmbedCall It What You Want Lyrics
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
"You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (Would you run away?)

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want... to100EmbedNew Year’s Day Lyrics
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)69EmbedReputation Magazine Vol. 1 Lyrics5EmbedWhy She Disappeared  LyricsWhen she fell, she fell apart.
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends
When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
"Whatever you say, it is not right."
"Whatever you do, it is not enough."
"Your kindness is fake."
"Your pain is manipulative."
When she lay there on the ground,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
and a love that was really something,
Not just the idea of something.
When she finally rose, she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises,
Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes
When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something,
not just the idea of something.
When she turned to go home,
She heard the echoes of new words
"May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice"
And even louder:
"without your past,
you could never have arrived-
so wondrously and brutally,
By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance
...here."
And in the death of her reputation,
She felt truly alive.28EmbedIf You’re Anything Like Me  LyricsIf you're anything like me,
You bite your nails,
And laugh when you're nervous.
You promise people the world,
because that's what they want from you.
You like giving them what they want...
But darling, you need to stop,
If you're anything like me,
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
You cross your fingers, hold your breath,
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...
If life gets too good now,
Darling, it scares you.
If you're anything like me,
You never wanted to lock your door,
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore
For fear she was much better before...
But Darling, now you have to.
If you're anything like me,
There's a justice system in your head
For names you'll never speak again,
And you make your ruthless rulings.
Each new enemy turns to steel
They become the bars that confine you,
In your own little golden prison cell...
But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.
If you're anything like me
You've grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs
And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last...
But Darling, you keep trying.
If you're anything like me,
You couldn't recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...
Darling, later on you will thank your stars
for that frightful day.
If you're anything like me,
I'm sorry.
But Darling, it's going to be okay.24EmbedReputation  LyricsHere's something I've learned about people.
We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.
This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.
The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.
When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?
Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...
We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.
There will be no further explanation.
There will be just reputation.14EmbedWelcome to New York Lyrics
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York (New soundtrack)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York103EmbedBlank Space Lyrics
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over (Over), mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game (And you love the game)
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name1KEmbedStyle Lyrics
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)

And I should just tell you to leave
'Cause I know exactly where it leads
But I watch us go 'round and 'round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (Mmm, yeah)
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl

He says, "What you heard is true
But I can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
(A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
We never go out of style
Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh (Out of style)

Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (And when we go)
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style1KEmbedOut Of The Woods Lyrics
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, "I'm setting you free"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)
Oh, I remember

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah, yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good164EmbedAll You Had to Do Was Stay Lyrics

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back

Here you are now, calling me up

232EmbedI Wish You Would Lyrics
It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish I, wish I)

2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good

I wish we could go back

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
You'll see me in hindsight

Tangled up with you all night

Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again

Oh, oh, oh

Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say

I want you for worse or for better

Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl

Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why

And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)

Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I (I, I, I, I)

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I know places)
And you know for me, it's always you (I know places)
In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)
And I know for you, it's always me (I know places)

The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
(Oh)

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

(Oh, oh)
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'm finally clean160EmbedWonderland Lyrics
Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control
Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Eh, eh)

(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh
Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Eh, eh)

(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
Whoa, in Wonderland
I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad
Oh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better
Never better (Eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
And life was never worse but never better
In Wonderland188EmbedYou Are in Love Lyrics
One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, "Look up"
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says "You're my best friend"
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love (Ah)
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you (Ah)
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you (Ah)
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love109EmbedNew Romantics Lyrics
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace (Ahh)
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle (Every day is like a battle)
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing (Yeah)
To get knocked off our feet (Hey!)
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
So, come on, come along with me
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
The best people in life are free
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

Please, take my hand and
Please, take me dancing and
Please, leave me stranded
It's so romantic (It's so romantic)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

'Cause baby, I could build a castle (Oh, baby, I could build a castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me (At me)
And every day is like a battle (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
But every night with us is like a dream (Like a dream)
'Cause baby, I could build a castle (Castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle (And every day is like a battle)
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
The best people in life are free208EmbedI Know Places (Voice Memo) LyricsSo over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end
How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing
So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways
So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together
I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time
So I always wanna be prepared
I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said "I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else"
So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called "I Know Places"
So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song
"Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:
Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i
Na na na na waiting at the back door
They're around and the vultures come around
And you know that they won't, they won't us
Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us
And you come and sing and listen
I would not think about it but I'm not done
Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run
Baby, I know some places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places
Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places"
Or whatever
I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it's about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus
So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing
It would be, like, 
Like, very, like, beat. Now I'm just making weird sounds
Hope you like it!6EmbedI Wish You Would (Voice Memo) LyricsThis is another way I've written songs recently
This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes "I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."
And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said "Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me"
And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called "I Wish You Would", because Jack wrote back and said "I love that"
So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:
Okay so this is an idea called "I Wish You Would". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this
It's 2 am, in your car
Windows down, past my street the memories start
It's in the past
You drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
Do you like it!?5EmbedBlank Space (Voice Memo) LyricsSo this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying
Um, so I brought in this idea called "Blank Space," and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the "Oh!" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song
So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called "Blank Space"
"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Diamonds, seasides, all those things
 this song that 
Like, oh my God, listen in
Listen in, I do too
 honest 
We can all sing this and cry
 thinking, all this time
Oh my God, listen to me
Just forget what you've heard about me
Don't believe what you hear about me, hear about me
'Cause it's gonna be forever, or gonna go -
Yeah! Hey, hey!
Gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over -
This is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track
Long list of ex-love -
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
*Click* I'll write your name
I've got a blank space, baby
*Click* I'll write your name"
That's awesome! I love it
Oh my god, everyone's gonna kill you
Yeah!14EmbedMine Lyrics
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)43EmbedSparks Fly Lyrics
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly38EmbedBack to December Lyrics
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night"
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night"
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I'd go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
And I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night"
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I'd go back to December all the time

All the time79EmbedSpeak Now Lyrics
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"
Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh

I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

So don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, "Speak now"
And you say, "Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"39EmbedDear John Lyrics
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can"

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I should've known
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known

You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known46EmbedMean Lyrics
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

Well you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
Someday, I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar and pathetic and alone in life and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

Someday, I'll be living in a big ole city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?39EmbedThe Story of Us Lyrics
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
The story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're goin' down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end32EmbedNever Grow Up Lyrics
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up

Oh, oh
Don't you ever grow up
Oh (Never grow up), just never grow up22EmbedEnchanted Lyrics
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless (Please don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please don't have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please don't be in love with someone else)
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you63EmbedBetter Than Revenge Lyrics
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Whoa, whoa-ah-oh

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa (She deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"28EmbedInnocent Lyrics
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
It's never too late to get it back30EmbedHaunted Lyrics
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Woah, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
I know, I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone, no

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it44EmbedLast Kiss Lyrics
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last40EmbedLong Live Lyrics
I said, "Remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said, "Remember this feeling"
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved"
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered34EmbedSpeak Now  LyricsPrologue'Speak now or forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I've always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they'd kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens.
Real life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything.
I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we didn't speak up. When we didn't say 'I love you.' When we should've said 'I'm sorry.' When we didn't stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help.
These songs are made up of words I didn’t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world.
Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you’ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone.
What you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you’ll stutter and you’ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest.
So say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve, but it’s too late now.’
There is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it.
I don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.
Love, Taylor

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"24EmbedPicture to Burn Lyrics
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn31EmbedTeardrops On My Guitar Lyrics
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see49EmbedA Place In This World Lyrics
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's okay

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh I'm just a girl16EmbedCold as You Lyrics
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
(Died for you)

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
Ooh16EmbedThe Outside Lyrics
I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go

I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late, so you see

You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
Oh, yeah

How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh8EmbedTied Together with a Smile Lyrics
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true
'Cause I know you

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket (Pocket)
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
Oh, oh

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh, oh-oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, "Hey, by the way"

You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know

You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
La-la-la
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful, stay beautiful
Na-na-na, na-na20EmbedShould’ve Said No Lyrics
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong

You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, oh
I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no
No, no, no, no

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me27EmbedMary’s Song (Oh My My My) Lyrics
She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 a.m. riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, "I do," and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I
I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh, my, my, my14EmbedOur Song Lyrics
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song"
And he says
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again
Da-da-da-da

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again

Play it again, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song34EmbedI’m Only Me When I’m With You Lyrics
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well I'm only me when I'm with you

With you
Uh-huh-huh, yeah10EmbedInvisible Lyrics
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Oh, yeah, oh

There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you, let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Oh, yeah

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile8EmbedA Perfectly Good Heart Lyrics
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore (It's not unbroken anymore)
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break—
(Why) Would you wanna break it?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

Mmm-hmm4EmbedTeardrops on My Guitar (Pop Version) Lyrics
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do (Why I do)
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see3EmbedTaylor Swift  LyricsI love you'sI love you, family.

You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it (You can see right through it)
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills (Oh yeah, yeah)
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms (Your arms)
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table

Will you be there? (Yes, I will be there for you)
Can I still love you? (Yes, I been hurt before, before)
Not yet healed or ready (Not ready)
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady, no, no)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
So can you hold me?
If I let you, can you prove it to me? (Oh, no-no, no)
'Cause I need you to calm me down, babe
Gotta get out of my head (Oh, woah)
Tryna be here from this bed (Oh)
Just wanna know, just wanna know, know, know, baby (Hey)
Can you touch it like you believe in it, baby? (Oh, hey)
Let me think you never gonna leave on me, baby
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him, thankfully (Baby, don't leave)
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again (Woah)
Baby, baby (Woo-hoo)

Will you be there? (Will you be there? I'll still wait)
Can I still love you? (I'll still wait for you, babe, oh, no-no, no, can I still love you?)
Not yet healed or ready (Ooh, not ready)
Should I be goin' too steady? (No, no, ooh)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table, baby?

Ah, hey, yeah

I know I be on some bullshit
Know I be driving you crazy
But I know you love how I whip it
You can only stay mad for a minute
So come here and give me some kisses
You know I'm very delicious
You know I'm very impatient
Might change my mind, so don't keep me waiting
I just wonder, baby, if you're gonna stay
Even if, one day, I lose it and go crazy
I know this shit kinda heavy
I just wanna tell you directly
So, boy, let me know if you ready

Are you down? What's up?
Are you down? What's up?

Act so possessive and crazy (Crazy)
But I know that's just 'causе you love me
And you ain't scared to show mе your ugly
And maybe that's just how it's supposed to be
I'm the release, you the dopamine

And you wonder, baby, if I'm gonna stay
Even if one day, you lose it and go crazy
I know this shit kinda heavy (Heavy)
Just wanna ask you directly (Directly)

And I wanna play video games at 2 AM?
What if I need a friend? Will you ride 'til the end?
Am I enough to keep your love?

Yeah

You know you're really something, yeah
How we get here so damn fast?
Only you can tell me that
Baby, 'cause you know I'm coming back
You're making me forget my past
Never thought I’d feel like that again
I came to peace with my path
Now you got me off track
I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind

Mmm
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net

Let your guard down, girl
You know we came too far now, girl (Oh)
It's timе for you to play your part now
You know we hit that jewelry storе and we gon' ball out
Ups and downs, we had some fallouts (Ooh, yeah)
Put some ice on you, girl, let it thaw out (Ooh)
Girl, you're mine, it's safe to say
At the end of the day

I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind  (I don't mind, I don't mind)
Mmm (Sheesh, woo)
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said (Something that you said, said, ayy)
Is it real this time or is it in my head? (In my head, oh, in my head, head, yeah)
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net

(Yeah)
Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let me run away, run away, my baby
Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let me run away, run away

Girl, you got me tripping, falling, with no safety net
(With no safety net, oh-ah, baby)
Boy, it must be something that you said (Something that you said)
Is it real this time or is it in my head?

Said I'ma give you some instructions
That you can't be scared to try
I want you to touch it softly
Like the way you do my mind
It got body and it's smooth to touch
The same way as my skin
But don't you be scared

To run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared
So come run your hands through my hair
It's been way long overdue
Just like these inches down my back
Usually don't let people touch it
But tonight, you get a pass
Spend my dimes and spend my time
To keep it real, sometimes it's tracks
But I don't care, mmm

So run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared

Could I be more obvious? (Ooh)
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious?

Maybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon
If you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon
Maybe you should pack a suitcase too (Too)
I love the thought of you never leavin' (No)

Gettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'
Never thought I'd believe in love again

If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can’t help it (Help it)

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space

After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears

Another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I’m sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I’m not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much
I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright

And I won't say I’m feeling fine
After what I been through, I can’t lie

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin’ on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it’s shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted

I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time (This time)
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell (From hell)

Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah

Though I wish he were here instead
Don't want that living in your head
He just comes to visit me
When I'm dreaming every now and then (And then)
And after all that we been through (And after all that we been through)
There's so much to look forward to
What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you (With you)

Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should

Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​

Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel (Abel), Abel (Abel), Abel
I know you're able, willin’ and able

Falling, falling, boy, I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)
Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin’ from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Damn, damn)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

Thought you were somebody else, you (You)

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it

Mmm, last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep ('Sleep)
You're such a dream to me, mmm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe (If you can believe)
Mmm, you're such a dream to me

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like: "I love you—who starts a conversation like that?" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm

Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

The sun is setting and you're right here by my side
And the movie is playing, but we won't be watching tonight
Every look (Every look), every touch (Every touch)
Makes me wanna give you my heart (Ooh)
I be crushin' on you, baby
Stay right where you are, 'cause

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
I kiss his fingertips as I'm wishing he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis with some James Dean in his eyes
Puts his lips (Puts his lips) on my neck (On my neck)
Makes me wanna give him my body
I be fallin' for you, baby
And I just can't stop, 'cause

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
(Baby, I be fallin')
You're my moonlight, moonlight

He's so bossy, he makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip and just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy, but he's such a man
He knows just what it does when he’s holding me tight
And he calls me "moonlight" too101EmbedDangerous Woman Lyrics
(Oh, yeah)

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy (Oh, yeah)

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout)
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside

Still so into us

Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby

I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions

535EmbedOne Last Time Lyrics
I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go

I promise after that, I'll let you go

If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper

On the highway to hell, yeah

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart

How soon do we forget how we felt
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind? (Ooh)
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on (Uh-uh), mm, hold on, eh (Yeah)
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, mm, hold on, eh

You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
(Best, best, best mistake you ever had)
You, you, you, you
(Best, best, best mistake you ever had)
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you234EmbedBe My Baby Lyrics

Tell me something I need to know

Baby, in that moment, you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain

And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time

'Cause if you want to keep me

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell that you were just with her

And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say
I know I'm not your only

But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just a little bit, oh-oh, ooh, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I'm not your only, but at least I'm one
I heard a little love is better than none

Oh, babe
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit, my baby)
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want (Is all I want)
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for85EmbedHands On Me Lyrics

I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know "sorry" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are

You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

Ooh, hmm, ha, yeah
You are, you are, you are, ooh
You are, you are, you are
My everything101EmbedBang Bang Lyrics

I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself

Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's no one around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?
That we're living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

As I'm laying down with you every night
It still gets to me, that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew
I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

Only one
Be your only one

Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

The same arguments time and time again
And you watch them all happen
But they don't understand, no
Thinking you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)

I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
You don't know me
The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming

Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea

I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, you don't know me
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, but there is just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you, you, yeah

Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing 'cause time was all we spent

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you, you, yeah
Mmm, oh baby, oh babe17EmbedToo Close Lyrics
I want you (Oh)

You know what I want
I know what you don't
I should be the one you love on
Boy, you got my mind playing truth or dare
Daring me kiss you right here
But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show
I-woah-woah-woah

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me, and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close

Remember that girl that you used to date?
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great
So, what would you do?
What would you say if I said I loved you that way?

But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show, oh
I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close

I looked in my rearview mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we've found it (Found it)
Well, that's when we start turnin' around (Turnin' around)
You're sayin', "Baby, don't worry"

Can we get back to the way it was?

They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And sometimes I feel like we've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know, yeah
We can find our way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want

How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you
I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go

You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (Right there)
Right there (Right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there (What? Okay)
I'll always be right there (What?)
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement? (What?)
If my Benz turned back to public transportation (So swear)
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting (What?)
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary (Ooh)
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five-course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
And I'll never let you go (I got you)

You should know (Oh) I'm never gonna change (I'm never gonna change)
I'm always gonna stay (I'm always gonna stay) (Oh)
You call for me, I'm right there (I'm right there)
Right there (Ooh)
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there (B-I-G Sean Don)
I'll always be right there (Carry on, yeah)

(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
You got it (Oh) (Put your hands up, put your hands up)
I'll always be right there (Oh)  (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)

Got it, babe55EmbedTattooed Heart Lyrics
You don't need a lot of money
Honey, you don't have to play no games
All I need is all your lovin'
To get the blood rushing through my veins, oh

I wanna say we're going steady

No, it doesn't have to be forever

Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart

You don't need to worry about making me crazy
'Cause I'm way past that, yeah
And so just call me if you want me, 'cause you got me
And I'll show you how much I want to be on your tattooed heart

Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart

Wrap me in your jacket, my baby
And lay me in your bed
And kiss me underneath the moonlight

Oh-whoa
Oh-whoa
Here we go

I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'd find out that my heart was battered
Real hard (Real hard)
It's so hard (It's so hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's that hard (It's that hard)
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano, oh

I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard (It's not hard)

And how I'm doing things my way
If I got my piano, then I'm gon' be okay, baby

So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano

Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
Don't get mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
But it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go
But you will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (Oh-oh)
Your way back then
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't, no, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know

Now it's probably hard for you to hear
But there's nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands, boy, what you don't understand
Is a girl like me don't have no time to waste around

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
But it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go

But you will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (If you would've shown) (Oh-oh)

Now you'll never know, you'll never know
You'll never know
Boy, you should've told me, told me
You'll never know
Boy, you should've let me know
You'll never know
Boy, you could've been there for me
But now you'll never know, you'll never know

It's not my fault
You're a little bit too late
You're the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times
But none of that will change my mind, boy
You had a chance you'll never get back, get back, uh-uh

You will never know what we could have been
If you would've shown (If you would've shown, babe)
Your way back then (Way back then, baby)
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)

I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh

Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough
Huh-huh, baby
You know, you know, baby
Almost, is never enough, baby
You know, hey

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough (Is never enough, baby)
So close to being in love (So close)
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was (Baby)
But almost is never enough

Huh-huh, baby (Almost)
You know, you know, baby
Almost, is never enough, baby
You know, hey101EmbedPopular Song (Single Version) Lyrics
La-la, la-la

You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish
Standin' on the field with your pretty pompom
Now you're workin' at the movies sellin' popular corn
I coulda been a mess, but I never went wrong
'Cause I'm puttin' down my story in a popular song (La-la, la-la)
Ah-ah, I said I'm puttin' down my story in a popular song
My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singin' all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row 'cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go (Hey)

Always on the lookout for someone to hate
Pickin' on me like a dinner plate
You hid during classes and in-between 'em
Dunk me in the toilets, now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughin', got everyone clappin', askin'
How come you look so cool?
'Cause that's the only thing that I learned at school, boy
Uh-huh, I said that's the only thing that I learned at school
My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singin' all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, 'cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were

I told you once, "Get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be alright"
But some things are better left unsaid
To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said
Oh, I'm gonna say things like "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe

I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons
That some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things like "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up

I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons
That some things are better left unsaid24EmbedAshley Lyrics
Standing now, in the mirror that I built myself
And I can't remember why the decision wasn't mine
But it seems I'm only clingin' to an idea now
Took my heart and sold it out to a vision that I wrote myself
And I don't wanna be somebody in America just fighting the hysteria
I only wanna die some days

Someday, someday, when I burst into flames
I'll leave you the dust, my love
Hope a bit of it'll be enough to help remember the
Days when we came to this place
I told you I'd spill my guts, I left you to clean it up
I'm bursting out of the
Seems like now it's impossible to work this out
I'm so committed to an old ghost town
Is it really that strange if I always wanna change?
And if only the time and space between us wasn't lonely
I'd disintegrate into a thousand pieces
Think I'm makin' a mistake, but if I decide to break
Who will fill the empty space? So...

Now, if I figure this out
Apart from my beating heart
It's a muscle, but it's still not strong enough to carry the
Weight of the choices I've made
I told you I'd ride this out
It's gettin' harder every day
Somehow, I'm burstin' out of myself

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or
I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive
I'm just a fucked up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind
Don't assign me yours28Embed​clementine Lyrics
I'd like to tell you that my sky's not blue, it's violent rain
And in my world, the people on the street don't know my name
In my world, I'm seven feet tall
And the boys always call, and the girls do too
Because in my world, I'm constantly, constantly havin' a breakthrough (Hmm)
Or a breakdown, or a blackout
Would you make out with me underneath the shelter of the balcony?

'Cause I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
Wish I could see what it's like to be the blood in my veins
Do the insides of all of my fingers still look the same?
And can you feel it too when I am touchin' you?
And when my hair stands on ends, it's saluting you
The blush in your cheeks says that you bleed like me
And the 808 beat sends your heart to your feet
Left my shoes in the street so you'd carry me
Through a breakdown
Through a breakdown or a blackout
Would you make out with me on the floor of the mezzanine?

'Cause I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some

My face is full of spiderwebs, all tender, yellow, blue
And still with one eye open, well, all I see is you
I left my daydreams at the gate because I just can't take 'em too
Know my heart still has a suitcase, but I still can't take it through
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone (I don't need anyone)
I don't need anyone (I don't need anyone)
I just need everyone and then some (I just need everyone and then some)

I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
Oh-mmm, oh-mmm (Yep)29EmbedGraveyard Lyrics
It's crazy when
The thing you love the most is the detriment
Let that sink in
You can think again
When the hand you wanna hold is a weapon and
You're nothin' but skin

Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running
They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard (No, oh)

You look at me (Look at me)
With eyes so dark, don't know how you even see
You push right through me (Push right through me)
It's gettin' real
You lock the door, you're drunk at the steering wheel
And I can't conceal

Oh, 'cause I've been diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running

They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, it's funny how
The warning signs can feel like they're butterflies

Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard60EmbedYou should be sad Lyrics
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest (My chest)
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret (Regret)
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them

I'm gonna start this out by saying (By saying)
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts

But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)
I feel so sad (I feel so sad)
I tried to help you (I tried to help you)
It just made you mad
And I had no warning (I had no warning)
About who you are (About who you are)
Just glad I made it out without breaking down
Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)
I feel so sad (I feel so sad)
I tried to help you (I tried to help you)
It just made you mad
And I had no warning (I had no warning)
About who you are (About who you are)
'Bout who you are
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah

'Cause you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

I feel so sad
You should be sad

You should be

I spent a long time watering a plant made out of plastic
And I cursed the ground for growing green
I spent a long time substituting honest with sarcastic
And I cursed my tongue for being mean

And weightless, breathless restitute
Motionless and absolute
You cut me open, sucked the poison from an aging wound
Now fifty thousand war cadets
Would cower at this small brunette
To my surprise, not six feet high
Who'd reach and grab the moon if I
Should ask or just imply
That I wanted a bit more light
So I could look inside his eyes
And get the colors just right
Just right, just right, just

Build love, build God, build provinces
Build calluses, break promises
'Cause I could never hold a perfect thing and not demolish it
What am I thinking? What does this mean?
How could somebody ever love me?
Talk to your man, tell him he's got bad news comin'30EmbedDominic’s Interlude Lyrics
Your eyes are fragile and timeless, it's beautiful
There's power in the words you whisper
He treats you cold and so mindless
That he don't see the setting sun
Your eyes are open when you kiss him

Your eyes are drawn to the wine list (Wine, baby, baby)
The usual, the towers in your world are sinkin'
And if you're lookin' for signs then, you should know (Ooh)
There's power in the words you're thinkin'
Talk to your man
Tell him he got bad news comin' (Yeah)
Walk on the edge with someone new
Talk to your man (Talk to your man)
Time to have some good time lovin' (Talk, talk)
You can take a chance, come take my hand18EmbedI HATE EVERYBODY Lyrics
I'm my own biggest enemy
Yeah, all my empathy's a disaster
Feelin' somethin' like a scaly thing
Wrapped too tightly 'round my own master
My friends are gettin' bored of me
Sayin' I fell in love with a stranger
I don't know what they all think of me
But in reality, I don't even

Remember anything but thinkin' you're the one
And I can force a future like it's nothing
So I'll just hate everybody
Well, then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really, I could fall in love with anybody who don't want me
So I just keep sayin' I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't

I know I've got a tendency
To exaggerate what I'm seein'
And I know that it's unfair of me
To make a memory out of a feelin'
It's 'cause I notice every single thing
That's ever happening in the moment
And I don't know why it's consumin' me
Because honestly, all I know is

Infatuation's observation with a cause
But none of it is love, so while I'm waitin' for it

I'll hate everybody
Well, then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really, I could fall in love with anybody who don't want me
So I just keep sayin' I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't
If I could make you love me
Maybe you could make me love me
And if I can't make you love me
Then I'll just hate everybody

Everybody
Well, then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really, I could fall in love with anybody who don't want me
So I just keep sayin' I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't22Embed3am Lyrics
Darling, I've just left the bar
And I've misplaced all my credit cards
My self-preservation and all of my reservations
Are sittin' and contemplating what to do with me, do with me
Think I took it way too far
And I'm stumblin' drunk, getting in a car
My insecurities are hurtin' me
Someone please come and flirt with me
I really need a mirror that'll come along and tell me that I'm fine
I do it every time
I keep on hanging on the line, ignoring every warning sign
Come on and make me feel alright again

'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone

And every night, I wanna live in color through a white-blue screen
I got a technicolor vision going vivid in my white-blue jeans
I know it's complicated
'Cause everyone that I've dated says they hate it
'Cause they don't know what to do with me, do with me
Know that my identity's always getting the best of me
I'm the worst of my enemies
And I don't really know what to do with me
Yeah, I don't really know what to do with me
I keep on hanging on the line, ignoring every warning sign
Come on and make me feel alright again

'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone

I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone

I'm reckless, treat it like a necklace
Take a different version and I try it on for size with everybody that I know
And will you please pick up the fucking phone?
'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone

It's already a hit, it's just gonna get more massive

Congratulations!45EmbedWithout Me Lyrics
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

You don't have to say just what you did (What you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (Oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)195EmbedFinally // beautiful stranger Lyrics
Your eyes, so crisp, so green
Sour apple baby, but you taste so sweet
You got hips like Jagger and two left feet
And I wonder if you'd like to meet
Your voice is velvet through a telephone
You can come to mine, but both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow

Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing, but the truth is this
That I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but I can't resist
And I said
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
But I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

I grab your hand and then we run to the car
Singing in the street and playing air guitar
Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar
And I wonder if it goes too far to say
I've never recognized a purer face
You stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place
Used to think that loving meant a painful chase
But you're right here now and I think you'll stay

Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing, but the truth is this
I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but the truth is this
I said
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
And I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally38EmbedAlanis’ Interlude Lyrics
And down came your innocence

A shining badge, a suit to match
Bit my nails down so they wouldn't scratch
But who believes with knees like these?
I'll take two of 'em, please

With soft skin, soft eyes
All these beautiful laughs and beautiful thighs
They always kept me up at night
But I can't change my appetite
'Cause your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me
Your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me

'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
And I have never felt the difference
'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
Tired of all these labels

And my girl, she always wore a skirt in the classroom
Eatin' my dessert in the bathroom
Can't get caught, so we stiller than a statue
Bad news, think I'll probably die before I have you

Soft skin, soft eyes
All these beautiful laughs and beautiful thighs
They always kept me up at night
But l live for lovin' impolite
'Cause your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me
Yeah, your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me (Hey, yeah)

'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
And I have never felt the difference
'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
Tired of all these labels

'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
And I have never felt the difference
'Cause he is she is her

You're killing people
No, I'm killing boys
Boys are just placeholders, they come and they go
You're my best friend, and I wanna help you
But I won't let you kill again
That's a lose-lose

Told me pick my battles and be pickin' 'em wise
But I wanna pick 'em all and I don't wanna decide
No more, no more, anymore
So we'll sneak in in the back and then we'll kick in the door
Tell me, have you ever keyed a Ferrari before?
Oh no, I don't anymore
And I'm not breakin', I won't take it
And I won't ever feel this way again
'Cause you don't need me anymore, woah
And I won't ever try again
And all I want in return is revenge
'Cause I don't need you anymore, woah
So where do you go?

Pull up to the drive and I remember the codes
Yeah, the only fuckin' numbers you don't hide in your phone
No more, no more, anymore
Climb up to the window and I'm breakin' the glass
Then I stop, 'cause I don't wanna Uma Thurman your ass
No more, no more, anymore

And I'm not breakin', I won't take it
And I won't ever feel this way again
'Cause you don't need me anymore, woah
And I won't ever try again
And all I want in return is revenge
'Cause I don't need you anymore, woah

To separate the time

They told me once, nothing grows
When a house ain't a home
Is it true, honestly
When it's all a part of me?
A couple years of waiting rooms
Finding God, and lose Him too
Wanna scream, but what's the use?

Lyin' awake, and I stare at the door
I just can't take it no more
They told me it's useless, there's no hope in store
But somehow I just want you more
I want you more
Somehow, I just want you more
I want you more
Somehow, I just want you more

Wooden floors and little feet
A flower bud in concrete
Feelin' so incomplete
Wonder will we ever meet?
And would you know it right away
How hard I tried to see your face?
A little screen, a photograph, mine to take

I sit and I stare at your clothes in the drawer
I cry and my knuckles get sore
'Cause I still believe it won't be like before
And now, somehow, I just want you more

I want you more
Somehow, I just want you more
I want you more
Somehow, I just want you more
And when you decide it's your time to arrive
I've loved you for all of my life
And nothing could stop me from giving a try
I've loved you for all of my life

Loved you more

But I'm livin' with a security team

And you wouldn't believe
Everything that I seen, no
Comin' apart at the seams
And no one around me knows
Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm tryna make it right
To the one I love, bring me 'round

But I'm still learning to love myself

I'm still learning to love myself
(To love my–, to love my–, to love my–) Yeah, yeah

I should be living the dream
But I go home and I got no self-esteem (Nope)
You think I'm swimmin' in green
But it's passed around my family tree
No man wants to really commit
Intimidated 'cause I get paid and shit
In the crowd, you're readin' my lips
But no one around me knows

Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm tryna make it right

I really was born at 9:29 AM on 9/29
You think I'm lying, but I'm, I'm being dead serious (I gotta see this birth certificate)
Okay, I'll prove it

Well, who am I? I'm almost 25
Can't remember half the time that I've been alive
'Cause half was in a cheap apartment
And half was on the Eastside (Eastside)
They said don't meet your heroes, they're all fuckin' weirdos
And God knows that they were right
Because nobody loves you, they just try to fuck you
Then put you on a feature on the B-Side
And who do you call when it's late at night?
When the headlines just don't paint the picture right
When you look at yourself on a screen and say
"Oh my God, there's no way that's me"
And I, I quit smoking, well recently, I tried
And I bought another house, and I never go outside
And I remember this girl with pink hair in Detroit
Well, she told me
She said, "Ashley, you gotta promise us that you won't die
'Cause we need you," and honestly, I think that she lied
And I remember the names of every single kid I've met
But I forget half the people who I've gotten in bed
And I've stared at the sky in Milwaukee
And hoped that my father would finally call me
And it's just these things that I'm thinkin' for hours
And I'm pickin' my hair out in clumps in the shower
Lost the love of my life to an ivory powder
But then I realize that I'm no higher power
That I wasn't in love then, and I'm still not now
And I'm so happy I figured that out
I've got a long way to go until self-preservation
Think my moral compass is on a vacation
And I can't believe I still feed my fucking temptation
I'm still looking for my salvation
Soft and slow, watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself
Watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself

I think I have a confession to make, I feel like (So we know you don't)
I need to say that I was really born at 9:26
It's on my birth certificate, I'm a liar
Man, I'm a fucking liar

Soft and slow, watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself24EmbedYou Signed Up For This Lyrics

Shout if you want my heart
It is an open invitation
Shout if the line's gone dark
Oh, if I've called you from the station
Shout if we grew apart
Actually don't, it's my narration
Shouting for me is hard
Hard, hard

Can you tell I'm trying?
Running out of breath
I know I'll get better

Scared of everything but I'm making it punk
A small towner, I only drink to get drunk
Don't go out much, 'cause there's too many bugs
And I'm way too obsessed with death to do any drugs
Six girls on Alphabet Road
5'1, do you think that I'll grow any more?

That's probably it
I guess Ellen was right
Yeah, she usually is

London 2020
Boy and a girl broke up, yeah, it's two a penny
And I been tryna make a big step forward
Saw you, it was awkward
Nothing like I thought would happen happened
I was so in love, and that don't come off in the wash
Kinda hope it does, though
Coz you're seeing someone pretty and I hate her guts
So I'll be telling you she's nice on the bus home
We were bad but we're gonna be good
It didn't work like I thought it would
And I resent you just a little if I'm honest
But one of us has gotta try to keep a promise
And I swore that I'd swallow my pride
And you swore you would do better this time
Well, I might be bitter and twisted and broken and petty and lying
But at least I'm trying
(At least I'm trying)
At least I'm trying
Three shots, lemon drops
One for being lost and alone in your early twenties
One for being obsessed with someone who puts you secondary
One for calling guys with guitars in a cemetery
Just me? Ok
If I'm being frank, I want a "sorry" but I'll settle for a handshake
'Cause I'm the baby but I'm gonna be the bigger man, babe
So many blank slates I could build a whole fucking house

We were bad but we're gonna be good
It didn't work like I thought it would
And I resent you just a little if I'm honest
But one of us has gotta try to keep a promise
And I swore that I'd swallow my pride
And you swore you would do better this time
Well, I might be bitter and twisted and broken and petty and lying
But at least I'm trying
At least I'm trying
Not friends, no, we're somewhere in between
'Cause you're awful and I miss you and I killed you in my dream
Last night, even then you didn't care
It's a low when even in my dreams you still don't want me there
Got friends, got at least a healthy five
Yeah, some people think I'm funny, baby, don't look so surprised
We think that your girlfriend is a bore
But we're nice to her in public cause we're grown up and mature
Not friends
'Cause when I asked you on the train why you hurt me and you couldn't really actually explain
I cried, then I told you it was cool
God, you haven't changed at all!

We were bad but we're gonna be good
It didn't work like I thought it would
And I resent you just a little if I'm honest
But one of us has gotta try to keep a promise
And I swore that I'd swallow my pride
And you swore you would do better this time
Well, I might be bitter and twisted and broken and petty and lying
And you might be awful like all of the time, yeah, it's almost inspiring
But at least I'm trying
At least I'm trying
At least I'm trying5EmbedJohn Hughes Movie Lyrics
This wasn't how it's supposed to go
I should be the one you're dancing with
Spinning with a vodka coke
Everybody at my fingertips
I was gonna get my coat
And baby, you were meant to follow me
And I was gonna act surprised
Even though I'd know you wanted me

It's not like I've been crying, no
There's just smoke in my eyes
'Cause this ain't no John Hughes movie where the girl gets the guy
You look right through me every time you walk by
I keep waiting for the heartbreak music that's never gonna come
'Cause if you don't want me
Then you're not the one

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

Sitting on a bathroom floor
Trying to get my composure back
Think I built it up too tall
Knew I should've worn my Adidas
Maybe if I'd reined it in
You wouldn't wanna kiss somebody else
And you don't owe me anything
So I'm just gonna walk home by myself

It's not like I've been crying, no
There's just smoke in my eyes
'Cause this ain't no John Hughes movie where the girl gets the guy
You look right through me every time you walk by
I keep waiting for the heartbreak music that's never gonna come
'Cause if you don't want me
Then you're not the one

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, no, no, you're not the one

What am I gonna say?
What am I gonna do?
All of our stupid friends
Know that I'm here for you
Guess I misunderstood
Thought you liked me too
What am I gonna say?
What am I gonna do?
Everyone told me so
Don't wait around for you
Guess I misunderstood
Thought you liked me too
'Cause this ain't no John Hughes movie where the girl gets the guy
You look right through me every time you walk by
I keep waiting for the heartbreak music that's never gonna come
'Cause if you don't want me
Then you're not the one

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, oh, then you're not the one
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, na-na-na
Oh, no, no, you're not the one

You're not the one, not the one, no
You're not the one, not the one, no
Not the one, no
Oh, no, no, you're not the one
You're not the one, not the one, no
You're not the one, not the one, no
'Cause if you don't want me
Then you're not the one5EmbedOutdoor Pool Lyrics
Bleached tips and a rugby sweatshirt
Two apart in chemistry
First boy with a driver's license
Heard you took Rebecca to HMV
Saw you in the supermarket
With your mum, I was with mine, too
She could tell I was so obsessed with you

You’re asking if I wanna come out
It's a Wednesday night
I just took off my makeup
Hope my dad don't wake up
We went swimming in an outdoor pool
And you wouldn’t tell a soul at school
I'm just fifteen, I just want you, so that's cool
It's almost Skins if my eyes stay shut
But I don't swim and you're not in love
And you only kissed me after midnight in an outdoor pool

I smile through form all Monday
Hoping you feel the same
Then I heard by the sciencе lockers
Kate caught you kissing the Frеnch exchange
Is she gonna be your girlfriend?
Guess I misunderstood
It's the worst day of my life, but it's all good

Well, tell me where I went wrong
I’m crying and it’s ruining my makeup
Hope my dad don't wake up

We went swimming in an outdoor pool
And you wouldn’t tell a soul at school
I'm just fifteen, I just want you, so that's cool
It's almost Skins if my eyes stay shut
But I don’t swim and you're not in love
And you only kissed me after midnight in an outdoor pool
(Ah-ooh)
Thought it was gonna be us
Cuffed for summer
(Ooh)
Thought that we'd dress up on Halloween
(Ooh)
I'm still in that movie

When we went swimming in an outdoor pool
And you didn't tell a soul at school
I was fifteen, now I'm fifteen and a fool (Fool)
It's almost Skins if my eyes stay shut
But I don't swim and you're not in love
And you only kissed me once
Nothing changed at all
When you kissed me after midnight in an outdoor pool
In an outdoor pool2EmbedLove Him I Don’t Lyrics
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh (Is this an intro? Okay)
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh

I could see a bloodbath coming
Playing checkers as the flat was flooding
I wasn't eating and you still said nothing
Better, should’ve known, should've known better
But I dug my heels in
Got really good at underwater breathing
Guess that was my stubborn season
Better, should've known, should’ve known better
Baby, it's sad, you're bad in the bones
So I just went home

Now it's coming up roses
Kicking up snow
What a long winter
What a bad joke
Shady when we held hands
Everyone else can have him but I won't
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Love him I don't
Love him I won't
Love him I did for a minute, but I'm finishеd ’cause I’ve learnt
Loving him hurts
Loving him don't work
So lovе him I don’t

Met you through my favourite cousin
Lighting cigarettes off an oven
Fell for you and got a bad concussion
Should've, better, known, should've known better

What a state, what a waste of your twenties
Couple lies, couple times, that's plenty
Oh, you’re bad in the bones, so I'm just going home
Don't text me
Now it's coming up roses
Kicking up snow
What a long winter
What a bad joke
Shady when we held hands
Everyone else can have him but I won't
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Love him I don't
Love him I won't
Love him I did for a minute, but I'm finished 'cause I've learnt
Loving him hurts
Loving him don't work
So love him I don't
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Oh, love him I don't
Love him I won't
Love him I did for a minute, but I'm finished 'cause I've learnt
Loving him hurts
Loving him don't work
So love him I don't

Baby, it's sad, you're bad in the bones
So I just went home
Now it's coming up roses
Kicking up snow
What a long winter
What a bad joke
Shady when we held hands
Everyone else can love you but I won't

Loving you hurts
And I loved you first
It didn't work out, and I wanted it to work
Loved you, I swear
Loving you's not fair
So love you I don't2EmbedPsycho Lyrics
You kept me as your favourite secret
And I thought we just took it slow
They said your girlfriend's from the beaches
It's funny how everybody but me knows

I feel like you feel nothing, that's fine
Please leave this behind
You're losing your mind
Calling me a hundred times
Time you drew a line
And stopped wasting mine
Miss me? That's a lie-ie-ie
Now that I'm over that hill
You wanna say how you feel
Crazy to think that you still call me psycho
You wanna talk? Not ideal
Heard I moved on? Babe, that's real
And you've got a girl, but you still call mе psycho
Now that I'm over that hill
You wanna say how you feel
Crazy to think that you still call me psycho
You wanna talk? Not ideal
Hеard I moved on? Babe, that's real
And you've got a girl, but you still call me psycho

Playing a perfect Patrick Bateman
Put blame on anyone but you
All kinds of ghosts down in your basement
You made me feel so useful, then so used

I feel like you feel nothing, that's fine
Please leave this behind
You're losing your mind
Calling me a hundred times
Time you drew a line
And stopped wasting mine
Miss me? That's a lie-ie-ie
Now that I'm over that hill
You wanna say how you feel
Crazy to think that you still call me psycho
You wanna talk? Not ideal
Heard I moved on? Babe, that's real
And you've got a girl, but you still call me psycho
Now that I'm over that hill
You wanna say how you feel
Crazy to think that you still call me psycho
You wanna talk? Not ideal
Heard I moved on? Babe, that's real
And you've got a girl, but you still call me psycho

You don't want me at all
But you don't want me to fall for anyone
But you'll go with anyone
And you still call me psycho
You don't want me at all
But you don't want me to fall for anyone
When all is said and done
You still call me psycho

All your exes found me and so beware
We're all friends now
Maybe you should be scared
You're so crazy
Baby, who has two phones?
One for her and one to still call me psycho
Now that I'm over that hill
You wanna say how you feel
Crazy to think that you still call me psycho
You wanna talk? Not ideal
Heard I moved on? Babe, that's real
And you've got a girl, but you still call me psycho3EmbedBoy Lyrics
Ooh!

I heard you had a lot of therapy
When you were seventeen
For your anger issues
If I had a pound for every hole
I saw punched in a wall
I'd be a rich girl
In love is something that you'll never be
It got progressively harder to miss you
And you should take this personally
Hmm
You're a serial cheater
"You up?" text repeater
When I told you you were funny I lied
You're a 'love 'em and leave 'em with a tеrrible reason
Shh, now is not the timе to reply

Boy, you think I'm dumb, tryna pull one on me like I've never been kissed
You had a couple of exes and I know that they let you get away with it
But you're a...
Boy (Hmm-hmm-hmm)
And I can tell that you've never been hugged, boy (Hmm-hmm-hmm)
And I can do better than this
Oh, better than this

La la la la la la la la la la la la la
I can do better than
I can do better than this (Hey)
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
I can do better than
I can do better than this

You said I'd meet your friends eventually
When you're ready to be
A little more exclusive
If I was the last girl on earth
You'd still be weighing up your options
Mmm
You said you got a lot of enemies
And you claim your dreams are always lucid
But you're just high and can't tell the difference
She tries to get closer
So you go and ghost her
Like it's perpetual Halloween
You're obsessed with your father
Red flag and a half, yeah
Babe, we could unpack it for weeks

Boy, you think I'm dumb, tryna pull one on me like I've never been kissed
You had a couple of exes and I know that they let you get away with it
But you're a...
Boy (Hmm-hmm-hmm)
And I can tell that you've never been hugged, boy (Hmm-hmm-hmm)
And I can do better than this
Oh, better than this

La la la la la la la la la la la la la
I can do better than
I can do better than this
La la la la la la la la la la la la la

You're kinda sociopathic
I nearly buried the hatchet
Then I remembered how you messed with my head
I could be a grown-up
But, baby, you know what?
Maybe I'll release this song instead
Boy, you think I'm dumb
Tryna pull one on me like I've never been kissed
You had a couple of exes and I know that they let you get away with it
But you're a...
Boy (Hmm-hmm-hmm)
And I can tell that you've never been hugged, boy (Boy)
And I can do better than this
Oh, better than this

Better than who?
Better than you
Better than this

Better than who?
Better than you

I wasn't broken 'til you tried to fix me
I wasn't lonely 'til you came around
It's all magic 'til you see the trick, babe
It was eye to eye to word of mouth
We had a future 'til you made it history
I was yours until you let me down
I'd rather see love as an optimistic
Than know the things that I know now

The casualty of love is the price of being free
You said this is something that we both need
So how do you feel?
'Cause I feel
Hollow
This hurts so loud
Further than down
You left me hollow
Are you happy now?
I hope you're happy now

I feel, I feel, I feel
I feel, I feel, I feel

We never struggled for a conversation
'Til you couldn't find the words to say
Now I'm a comma in your explanation
Of your learning curves and your mistakеs
They say that it should be a celеbration
But I'm still crying in a cubicle
I wish you felt the way you used to
I wish you'd made me feel beautiful

You're the one that got away and you got away with a lot
They say it's better to have loved even if you lost
But I can tell you it's not
'Cause I feel
Hollow
This hurts so loud
Further than down
Oh, you left me hollow
Are you happy now?
I hope you're happy now

Oh, we lit up the night
Heart to heart, put the world to rights, and I
I'm here again
Now you're somebody else with somebody else you swore was not your type
I just miss my friend

And I feel hollow
Hollow
I just feel hollow
This hurts so loud
Further than down (Oh, further than down)
You left me hollow
Are you happy now?
I hope you're happy now2EmbedVillain Lyrics
You were sitting right there on the fire escape
And you look into her eyes, said, "I think it's gonna rain"
And I, I feel like screaming
Remember calling me the one and saying, "Don't freak out"
Now you're kissing that girl I shouldn't worry about
How do you think I'm dealing?

Of course I wanted you to stay
But you didn't
No, you didn't
No, you didn't
Of course I want you anyway
Course I do
Yeah I do
Now you're in her room, getting undressed
I curse you on the front of the steps
I'll burn this house, I mean it
If she's the girl of your dreams
The best thing you've ever seen
Well, what does that make me then?
I'm your villain

Oh, wait, na-na
Oh, wait, I know
I'm your villain
Oh, wait, na-na
Oh, wait, I know

Now I'm drunk and I'm mean outside your house
And you said, "This is getting ridiculous now"
Please, I don't need reminding
So I call you selfish
You call someone to get me
Saying, "Jesus Christ, just move on already"
Oh, don't you think I'm trying?

Of course I wanted you to change
But you didn't
No, you didn't
No, you didn't
Of course I want you anyway
'Course I do
Yeah I do
Now you're in her room, getting undressed
I curse you on the front of the steps
I'll burn this house, I mean it
If she's the girl of your dreams
The best thing you've ever seen
Well, what does that make me then?
I'm your villain

Oh, wait, na-na
Oh, wait, I know
I'm your villain
Oh, wait, na-na
Oh, wait, I know

(Oh)
Blacked out, babe, and I can't shut up
Whole town's gonna hear how you messed me up
You don't wanna know? Well, that's too bad
Oh, I'm out my mind and I said some shit
But I miss you more than I meant any of it
(Woah)
And isn't that just sad?
Now you're in her room, getting undressed
I curse you on the front of the steps
I'll burn this house, I mean it
If she's the girl of your dreams
You love her, everyone sees
Well, what does that make me then?
I'm your villain

Oh, wait, na-na
Oh, wait, I know
I'm your villain
Oh, wait, na-na
Oh, wait, I know
I'm your villain
I'm your villain2EmbedBrooklyn Lyrics
Village is dead
Gemini panic
Quick out of bed
Shuttle to Gatwick
Noodles for breakfast
Terrible tickets
I hate your tracksuit
Sister, I missed this

Flying and flying and flying with you on my shoulder
Only one jacket, fine, you can have it, you're older
Land at 11, straight to 42nd, it's colder
And we're dancing down the street
If you're looking, if you're looking for the girl of your dreams
She's in Brooklyn with me, she's in Brooklyn with me
If you're looking, if you're looking for the girl of your dreams
She's in Brooklyn with me, she's in Brooklyn with me

Give you an earphonе
Sleep on the last bus
What happened in Harlеm?
Don't even ask us
Sushi and a fake ID
You're Katie from Michigan
Wing woman
"He's fit, go for it"
But we wouldn't ever leave a sister behind

If you're looking, if you're looking for the girl of your dreams
She's in Brooklyn with me, she's in Brooklyn with me
If you're looking, if you're looking for the girl of your dreams
She's in Brooklyn with me, she's in Brooklyn with me

If you want to take her out, you're gonna have to ask me first
Come on, have you seen those eyes?
It's nothing but the best for her
Oh, if you're looking, if you're looking for the girl of your dreams
She's in Brooklyn with me, she's in Brooklyn with me
Flying and flying and flying with you on my shoulder
Only one jacket, fine, you can have it, you're older
Mum's in the car, she parked pretty far
I'm laughing, I told ya
I miss you already

If you're looking, if you're looking for the girl of your dreams
She's in Brooklyn with me, she's in Brooklyn with me
If you're looking, if you're looking for the girl of your dreams
She's in Brooklyn with me, she's in Brooklyn with me

And if you want to take her out, you're gonna have to ask me first
Come on, have you seen those eyes?
It's nothing but the best for her
Oh if you're looking, if you're looking for the girl of your dreams
She's in Brooklyn with me, she's in Brooklyn with me
If you're looking, if you're looking for the girl of your dreams
She's in Brooklyn with me, she's in Brooklyn with me1EmbedElvis Song Lyrics
(You were always on my mind)

Cold bench on a platform
Last train on the Northern Line
I'm trying to keep you out my mind
Too drunk for a drawbridge
Your name floods when my eyes are shut
We found love
You gave it all and I gave it up
I don't do it often
But when no one's watching
No one's watching
I'm thinking 'bout

Late nights in the old arcade
Drinking cheap wine as Elvis plays
Singing, "You were always on my mind"
I was yours and you were mine
Breakfast on your sofa bed
Thinking, "Oh God, I'm in over my head"
You were always on my mind
You're always on my mind

I've got no right to miss you
All I did was kiss and fly
Each time I stayed another night
I was scared to throw my hеart off the edge
Easiеr to tell myself we'd mess it up instead
So I left
But it plays round in my head

I don't do this often
But when no one's watching
No one's watching
I'm thinking 'bout
Late nights in the old arcade
Drinking cheap wine as Elvis plays
Singing, "You were always on my mind"
I was yours and you were mine
Breakfast on your sofa bed
Thinking, "Oh God, I'm in over my head"
You were always on my mind
You're always on my mind

(Mind, mind, mind)
You were always, always, always on my mind
(Mind, mind, mind)
You were always, always, always on my mind

In my mind, I hear it and I know nothing's changed
In my mind, we share earphones on the midnight train
And I've tried
You moved on and I moved a little too
But I still wish things were different
Don't you?

I never wanna stop thinking 'bout
Late nights in the old arcade
Drinking cheap wine as Elvis plays
Singing, "You were always on my mind"
I was yours and you were mine
Breakfast on your sofa bed
Thinking, "Oh God, I'm in over my head"
You were always on my mind
You're always on my mind

(Mind, mind, mind)
You were always, always, always on my mind
(Mind, mind, mind)
You were always, always, always on my mind
(Mind, mind, mind)
You were always, always, always on my mind
(Mind, mind, mind)
You were always on my mind1EmbedTalking To Strangers Lyrics
There's a man in a shop
Worked there for years
He knows your birthday
And I know that's weird
He keeps a scratchcard, aside every week
Coz you're superstitious, haven't missed one since you were sixteen

Oh, I can't stop, I can't just not
Tell the whole wide world and this room
No, I can't stop, even if I wanted to talking to strangers about you
Talking to strangers about you
There's a guy on a plane
Who knows you hate flying
The girl doing laps in the pool knows you learnt how to swim in Hawaii
Don't know I do it, I catch myself sometimes
So I try change the subject, 'causе I get not everyonе sees you the way that I'd like

But I can't stop, I can't just not
Tell the whole wide world and this room
No, I can't stop, even if I wanted to, talking to strangers about you
Talking to strangers about you

Babe, if you knew, even half of a clue
What I'm telling these strangers
In every bar, every bus stop, every car
They talk 'bout the news - I just talk about you

Coz I can't stop, I can't just not tell the whole wide world and this room
No, I can't stop, even if I wanted to
Talking to strangers about you
Talking to strangers about you
Talking to strangers about you2EmbedVolcano Lyrics
I wished you happy birthday, and you still said nothing
I'll throw you in a volcano, I hope death is sudden
And when I say I'm sorry, baby, I'll be bluffing

You got away with it
You crossed then burnt the bridge
Oh yeah, you did
And your friends said nothing
You pulled a lot of shit
I sat and bit my lip
Oh yeah, I did
And the world said nothing
All or nothing
You chose nothing
Pulled a parachute as the ground came rushing
You got away with it, with it, with it
Yeah, all or nothing
You felt nothing
Pulled a parachute as the ground came rushing
You got away with it, with it
Thought I'd be a cool girl, but turns out I'm livid
I'll cry you a river, then I'll drown you in it
Bet you hope I'm done, but there's no way I'm finished
No

You got away with it
You crossed then burnt the bridge
Oh yeah, you did
And your friends said nothing
You pulled a lot of shit
I sat and bit my lip
Oh yеah, I did

And your friends said
So I said
Oh, oh

When you stood there
You just stood there
No, no

We rode it to a dead end
Saying goodbye to a best friend
Is the bad part of the right thing to do
I was hard to handle
And we burnt out like a birthday candle
The pictures on the mantle, aren't true

Everybody knows that a breakup
Is better when there’s someone to hate but
You were my favourite way to stay up, and I'd say that still
I know the reasons
Took a couple tries to see 'em
But now everything is through, it’s you I wanna call, though
When all I've known of
Is something that I should let go of
I'll cut it at the root and drain it 'til it's all so hollow
But you are one tough act to follow

I got busy
And you forgot how to miss me
When I'm not much of who you grew up with
Oh, you were distracted
And the silence made a hat trick
It's a long list with a lasting fix

Everybody knows that a breakup
Is better when there's someone to hate but
You were my favourite way to stay up, and I’d say that still

I know the reasons
Took a couple tries to see ’em
But now everything is through, it's you I wanna call though
When all I’ve known of
Is something that I should let go of
I'll cut it at the root and drain it 'til it's all so hollow
But you are one tough act to follow
And I know that we weren’t perfect
So I hope you meet someone tomorrow
And she's everything you wanted
But I hope I'm one tough act to follow

I know the reasons
Took a little time to believe 'em
But now everything is through, it's you I wanna call though
When all I've known of
Is something that I should let go of
I'll cut it at the root and drain it 'til it's all so hollow
But you are one tough act to follow
You are one tough act to follow2EmbedNeck of the Woods Lyrics
You're my neck of the, neck of the woods
Leave you, babe, I never could
Ginger and gestures of goodwill go forth, let go
Of sorrow and sadness and spite
I'm somebody taller tonight
And everything went as it should
Yeah, in my neck of the woods, baby yeah
My summer of, summer of pain
Buckets and bullets of rain
Falling asleep in a hospital waiting room
'Stead of holding it over my head
Baby, you held me instead
And everything went as it should
Yeah in my neck of the woods, baby, yeah
You found mе out
Oh, don't you know?
You're my whole house (Yеah)

Got a secondary, secondary chance
So I'm taking my love to the dance
And all of my demons are wallflowers watching us
But, darling, I pay 'em no mind
You just look so pretty tonight
And everything's looking so good
Yeah, in my neck of the woods, baby yeah
It was a terrible, terrible year
But I'm putting a face to the fear
And, honey, I'm finding that ghosts are just kids in paint
I'm scared but I'm never alone
And I'd swim to your call on my phone
And everything's looking so good
Yeah, in my neck of the woods, baby, yeah
You found me out
Oh, don't you know?
You're my whole house (Yeah)

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm (Neck of the, neck of the woods)
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm (Leave you, babe, I never could)
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm (Neck of the, neck of the woods)
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm (Leave you, babe, I never could)
I never lost sight of it (Neck of the, neck of the woods)
Oh, I won't let you leave (Leave you, babe, I never could)
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm (Neck of the, neck of the woods)
Neck of the, neck of the woods1EmbedMilhouse Lyrics
I think it's all gonna work out
And I thought that yesterday and when I was sixteen
And both of those times it didn't, but
I think it's all gonna work out
Don't need a blood moon or a horoscope to tell me
That this time will be different

A little drop of honey and the picture's clearing up
Cup of coffee spilling over, oh, cleaning all my cuts
A pessimist by nature, but in you, baby, I trust
Oh, everything's coming up Milhouse
(Mmm)
I think it's gonna be good news
'Cause you deserve it and we're somewhat decent people
Or at least trying to be
And the world is awful and the ice caps they are melting
But today you bought me flowers
So, I'm choosing to believe

The future is a wishing well and I'm gonna invest
Throw a couple of pounds in, oh, lying on your chest
A pessimist by nature, but in you, baby, I trust
Oh, everything's coming up Milhouse

Sorry it's strange that I'm crying
Think it's because you're the one

I think it's all gonna work out
And I thought that yesterday and when I was sixteen
And both of those times it didn't

But a little drop of honey and a little glass of rain
Babe, you'll be surprised how much a girl can change
A pessimist by nature, but in you, darling, I trust
Oh, everything's coming up Milhouse1EmbedFuneral Lyrics
I know it's not how you planned it
But that's not the worst thing in the world
I know that you're scared
'Cause you think I'll let you down again
But I wouldn't, girl

I want you to want me when you're dead
To roll in your grave like we're not done yet
To call off the whole damn funeral
'Cause our love is so damn beautiful
I want you to know that the past is past
That everything changed when I heard you laugh
'Cause you sitting there with your headphones in
You were the point of all this living
I'm sure that you're right
And I can't blame you for things you haven't done yеt
Even if I'm scared you will
And I think a lot about May
About meeting you that day
I was late and a sеrial blusher
Never made it to the second date

But I want you to want me despite all that
To live every day like the plane might crash
To chase every satellite and star
I'd pin all of my hopes to your handlebars
The truth is I'd be such a jealous ghost
I'd scrub all your lovers' names out the stone
'Cause you sitting there with your headphones in
You were the point of all this living

Your heart was full of boys and brimstones
Yours was full of girls who lied
Both got hurt by other people
Both found each other, baby, right in time
I don't need to live forever, just not one day longer than you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I want you to want me when you're dead
To roll in your grave like we're not done yet
To call off the whole damn funeral
Because our love was so damn beautiful6EmbedHelicopter Lyrics
Babe, without me you are just so defenseless
From motorbikes and girls who might try break your heart
So I'm pretty sure that I should make you breakfast
And then I should never leave the front seat of your car
You are important, so of course it maddens me
When you're nonchalant about your own mortality
Please be more careful when you cross the road
You're a perfect arrangement of rickety bones

So forgive me, if I hover close
I'm a helicopter, 'cause I love you so
Oh, bear with me
Darling, you should know
I'm a helicopter, 'cause I love you so
It's not interfering if you can't be trusted
To treasure that heart like I do
Your sense of danger is antique and rusted
And mine's laser sharp, oh, when it comes to you
When you wait for a train, don't cross the yellow line
Don't run with scissors, and don't text and drive
Call me the minute you get to your dad's
I'll be worried all night and I won't wanna ask

So forgive me, if I hover close
I'm a helicopter, 'cause I love you so
Oh, bear with me
Darling, you should know
I'm a helicopter, 'cause I love you so

So, so (Mmm-mmm)
So, so (Mmm-mmm)

Just forgive me, if I hover close
I'm a helicopter, 'cause I love you so1EmbedHappy Hunting Ground Lyrics
Build a timber frame
For future time's sake
We've had a lot of rain
Lucky I'm an English rose
Now interlaced, for worse or for better
My bird of a feather
There are good things coming for you

This could be your happy hunting ground
Everything you wanted
Well, you got it now
So don't take it for granted
I love you, don't take advantage (Oh, yeah)
This could be your happy hunting ground
Everything we dreamed of
Is falling out the clouds
So careful where your boots tread
Oh, protect the love that you get
Yeah
And you know I'll be here
'Cause we've got it all to lose
That's you included
Oh, so tie up the lace of your boots
Before we trip and fall again
With every hope that we've ever had
'Cause there are great things coming for us

And this could be your
Your happy hunting ground
Everything you wanted
Well, you've got it now
So don't take it for granted
I love you, don't take advantage (Oh, yeah)
This could be your happy hunting ground
Everything we dreamed of
Is falling out the clouds
So careful where your boots tread
Oh, protect the love that you get

And we got way too much to lose here, don't you think so?
It's too good, yeah, just to let it slip on by without a pause
And we've been stacking up the boxes trying to reach for what we wanted
Don't look down, oh, I know it was worth the cost
Oh, I have someone who adds things, yeah
This could be your happy hunting ground
Everything you wanted
Look, you got it now
So don't take it for granted
I love you, don't take advantage (Woah)
This could be your (Oh, this could be your)
Happy hunting ground
Everything we've dreamed of
Is falling out the clouds
So careful what you wish for
I'll have you and then a bit more2EmbedI Want You to Change (Because You Want to Change) Lyrics
Tryin', I'm not there, but I'm tryin'
And honestly, sometimes I think you want too much
Tryin', all this shit is tryin'
I'm not a movie hero, just a guy you say you love
Lyin', you say it's fine, you're lyin'
But how am I supposed to know that? I can't read that stuff
Tryin', can't you see me tryin'?
When did I wake up and find out tryin' isn't good enough?
Oh, woah
Oh, I don't wanna tell you I'm leavin'
And I won't if you give me an inch
Oh, I want you to change 'cause you want to change
I know I tried, can you say you did?

Tryin' doesn't mean you're changing
Doesn't mean the whole thing's getting fixed
Just means you want it to
Tryin' doesn't mean it's better
Doesn't mean you're magically the pеrson that I want from you
Tryin' doesn't make you perfеct
Really, it's the minimum you do for those you love
Tryin', I can see you tryin'
And no one ever told you sometimes trying isn't good enough
Oh, ooh

Oh, I don't wanna tell you I'm leavin'
And I won't if you give me an inch
Oh, I want you to change 'cause you want to change
I know I tried, can you say you did?
And I hate you right now, and God, I hate that
You're the love of my life, but this ain't no way to live
I want you to change 'cause you want to change
I tried, can you say you did?
How am I supposed to know you're lyin'?
You're just meant to know
What else is there left to do but tryin'?
Tryin' harder, oh
I don't know how to be what you want from me
And I have a feeling soon you won't be wanting me
I can't believe you can't see when I'm lyin'
Just tell me what to do
I love you and I'm sorry and I'm tryin'
And I'm tryin' too
But I don't know how to be what you want from me
And I have a feeling soon you won't be wanting me1EmbedThe Party Lyrics
I know I'm a piece of work
But I wanna make it work with you
Do the dishes with "Nebraska" in the background
Are you listenin', are you sat down?
Ankles in your lap, heart in your hand
How I got you, honey, even I don't understand
But I'm happy that we're here at the end of the year
Under winter skies

Oh, you and I are the last to leave the party
Swayin' under halogen lights
I'll take your chaos and your crooked in a heartbeat
Heart beats louder, I'm gonna make you proud of me
Oh, you and I are the last to leave the party
You're my favorite comic, my Jupiter comet
People ask how long have I loved you, no comment
'Cause probably since I was seven and you were eight
We didn't know each other, but baby, it was fate
And now we're in a freak storm every other weekend
Your friends think I'm bad news and a part of you believes them
I understand, I know how lucky I am

Oh, you and I are the last to leave the party
Swayin' under halogen lights
I'll take your chaos and your crooked in a heartbeat
Heart beats louder, I'm gonna make you proud of me
Oh, you and I are the last to leave the party

Water rings from cheap red wine
You're the only apple in my eye
And my dress is from a funeral
You mouthed, "Babe, you look beautiful"
From across the room, grin in your eyes
And I tell the group, "Look that's my guy"
And I think we'll be alright, I do

Oh, you and I are the last to leave the party
I'm never gonna leave your side
I'll take your chaos and your crooked in a heartbeat
Heart beats louder, I'm gonna make you proud of me
Oh, you and I are the last to leave the party2EmbedGlowing Review Lyrics
I think we got this
In a wedding dress and a Casio watch
This year's a plot twist
'Cause I'm not the sort to be certain a lot
Ran for the trenches and there you were humming "Strawberry Fields"
No more defenses, no more defenses

You are better than you know yourself
I found you off the highest shelf
I'll always feel the way I felt
Sat in a pub on the Heath
First kiss, first Friday in June
You asked what I'd tell my friends, said "It's a glowing review"
Baby nothing much has changed, I guess your buzzcut, it grew
But I'm still the girl with the blush, giving a glowing review
We'll make a home on the cracks, we'll tell nothing but the truth
And for the rest of my life, you'll get a glowing review
(Ooh, maybe)

Maybe it's perfect, maybe it's incredibly flawed
It doesn't matter
I'm happy honey, I'm locking the door
This is our shelter, birthdays are nailed to the fridge
What did I tell you, what did I tell you?

You are better that you know yourself
I found you off the highest shelf
I'll always feel the way I felt, felt, felt

Sat in a pub on the Heath
First kiss, first Friday in June
You asked what I'd tell my friends, said "It's a glowing review"
Baby nothing much has changed, I guess your buzzcut, it grew
But I'm still the girl with the blush, giving a glowing review
We'll make a home on the cracks, we'll tell nothing but the truth
And for the rest of my life, you'll get a glowing review
(Oh, yeah)
Blood moons, skylarks
My baby's out the ball park
Nice teeth, wide heart, I'll never need a hall pass
Eyes won't wander, it's my honor
All my future rested on you
Stairwell hideouts, smiling with your eyebrows
Life without ya, I never wanna find out
You're scared, me too
I won't leave you
I won't leave you
I won't leave you
I won't leave you
I won't leave you1EmbedLunar Years Lyrics
I know something that you don't know
Scathing down the landline, I still kind of love you
And I'm four steps forward in my plimsolls
But I still wanna stab any girl that wants to touch you
Church bells ringing for a fresh start
But you had a head start, always such an athlete
And no one wants to kiss a bad sport
So I keep my head high, wave at all your family

I knew you until you were someone else
And I don't know if you ever knew yourself
I guess we just weren't meant to be in love forever
And I guess people just change
You got good, I got better
But I still care about you, and I think I'll care forevеr
And I'm glad we got to do
All those perfеct, ugly, almost priceless
Lost and lovely lunar years together

I know something that you don't know
These days all our friends think you're kind of an arsehole
And I've been cleaning up my sad act
Incense in the hallways burning through the charcoal
London's pretty in the autumn, and I'm a nicer person
Now I'm not your person, funny how that works and
Funny that we're working now

I guess we just weren't meant to be in love forever
And I guess people just change
You got good, I got better
But I still care about you, and I think I'll care forever
And I'm glad we got to do
All those perfect, ugly, almost priceless
Lost and lovely lunar years together
Oh woah, mmm
Oh woah, yeah

I knew you until you were someone else
And I don't know if you ever knew yourself

I guess we just weren't meant to be in love forever
And I guess people just change
You got good, I got better
But I still care about you, and I think I'll care forever
And I'm glad we got to do
All those perfect, ugly, almost priceless
Lost and lovely lunar years together

Mmm1EmbedThis Is On You Lyrics
So you're calling me drunk
And you’re outside a club
And you're lonely in SoHo
And you hate everyone
And you wish I was there
It's no fun going solo
Now you wanna be friends
Always sad on weekends
And I was your pick-me-up
And I would say, "Pick me up"
But not anymore
Who gave it all, and held you up
When nobody else gave a fuck?
Who bailed you out?
That was all me
Who was your biggest fan and oldest friend?
Your steady hand you traded in
But still stuck around
Well that was all me

But this is on you
It’s your bed, babe, it's your funeral
This is on you
Did my best, babe, and you threw it all
Did all I could do
And you need me now but I'm clocking out
So this is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

And I get that you're hurt
Having issues at work
Always fight with your father
But for years I was there
Had your back, it's not fair
How you took me for granted
I went down with the ship
Always your therapist
Always your good luck charm
Hanging on to your arm
But not anymore
Who gave it all, and held you up
When nobody else gave a fuck?
Who bailed you out?
That was all me
Who was your biggest fan, and oldest friend?
Your steady hand you traded in
But still stuck around
Well, that was all me

But this is on you
It's your bed, babe, it's your funeral
This is on you
Did my best, babe, and you threw it all
Did all I could do
And you need me now but I'm clocking out
So this is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Who gave it all, and held you up
When nobody else gave a fuck?
Who bailed you out?
That was all me, yeah
Who was your biggest fan and oldest friend?
Your steady hand you traded in
Still stuck around
That was all me
But this is on you
It’s your bed, babe, it’s your funeral
This is on you
Did my best, babe, and you threw it all
Did all I could do
You need me now but I'm clocking out
So this is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is on you
But this is on you
It’s your bed, babe, it's your funeral
This is on you
Did my best, babe, and you threw it all (You threw it all)
Did all I could do
You need me now but I'm clocking out
So this is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)2EmbedAdore You Lyrics
Eyes meet across the floor
Your name, I underscore
My friends say, "What you waiting for?" (Maisie!)
(Oh, what are you waiting for?)
Fast forward, we're an easy thing
And your touch is a Paris spring
And my home is yours to settle in

Oh, you're always on my team
And I know, I know
That sometimes I get difficult to be
Oh, I'm
So high that I am floating
So good that I'm outta my head
So low, baby, I was hurting
You make it better again
Oh, we got caught in a moment
And I'll lay with you all night
So good that now I'm hoping
You'll hold me down for life

I adore, I adore, I adore you
Oh, you know
I adore, I adore, I adore you

My past was kinda hit and miss
I closed off, became a battleship
But you, babe, I'm at your fingertips
Woah, your fingertips
And this love, it's a subtle change
Now our plans, oh they're in uppercase
And I trust everything you say

'Cause you're always on my team
Even when nobody else would be
And I'm
So high that I am floating
So good that I'm outta my head
So low, baby I was hurting
You make it better again
Oh, we got caught in a moment
And I'll lay with you all night
So good that now I'm hoping
You'll hold me down for life

I adore, I adore, I adore you

That sometimes I make it really, really hard to be

So high that I am floating
So good that I'm on the edge
So low, baby I was hurting
You make it better again
Oh, we got caught in a moment
And I'll lay with you all night
So good that now I'm hoping
You'll hold me down for life
I adore, I adore, I adore you
Oh, you know

Oh, you know
I adore, I adore, I adore you (I adore you)

When it all goes bad
You're the shrink of the club
But you don't ever take your own advice
The world won't fall if you're not holding it up
Just take a minute, put your mind on ice

And you try and you try and you're trying
But the burden is heavy and overgrown
And God knows that we all get tired
It's a long night when you do it on your own, and I
I hate how you talk to yourself
It's not weak if you need to be held
So cut off a little slack
And roll all your cavalry back
My love, take care of yourself

Call your friends, send your ego away, no
Don't need to take it all so seriously
You don't get a medal for the last one awake, so
Rest your eyes and give your baggage to me

And you try and you try and you're trying
But the burden is heavy and overgrown
And God knows that we all get tired
It's a long night when you do it on your own, and I

I hate how you talk to yourself
It's not weak if you need to be held
So cut off a little slack
And roll all your cavalry back
My love, take care of yourself
And I hate how you're going through hell, yeah
When you'd never let anyone else
So cut off a little slack
And roll all your cavalry back
My love, take care of yourself
Yeah, my love, take care of yourself

All these things we hide behind
Let's not do that, you and I
Take a breath and take your time
Hold my gaze and we'll be fine

'Cause God knows that we all get tired
It's a long night when you do it on your own, and I

I hate how you talk to yourself
It's not weak if you need to be held
So cut off a little slack
And roll all your cavalry back
My love, take care of yourself

And I hate how you're going through hell, yeah
When you'd never let anyone else
So cut off a little slack
And roll all your cavalry back
My love, take care of yourself
Yeah, my love, take care of yourself
Yeah, my love, take care of yourself1EmbedApril Showers Lyrics
Ten days since we left things
I die just a little every minute that the phone don't ring
I heard you’re moving on
Heard you're growing on to her like a flower of spring
My phone's on my driveway
When I saw that she posted another picture at your brother’s place
I see it all
I blame the Aperol for asking all my friends for her name

When April showers, you wash her hair
She's got your heart inside her hands
As the water falls
I bet it's gonna wash out every thought you ever had of me
Every hour, I'm more aware
She's in your eyes, no underwear
As the water falls
I bet it's gonna wash out every thought you ever had of me
(The water falls)
(Me, me-e-e)
I bet it's gonna wash out every thought you ever had of me

Nine steps up to the first floor
Walk past your kitchen, dirty dishes from the night before
I see it all
Paracetemol and water on your bedside drawer

Bedsheets tangled in your bed
Bet she's laying on your left
Only picture in my head

When April showers, you wash her hair
She’s got your heart inside her hands
As the water falls
I bet it’s gonna wash out every thought you ever had of me
Every hour, I'm more aware
She’s in your eyes, no underwear
As the water falls
I bet it's gonna wash out every thought you ever had of me
I been going Jack Nicholson, crazy in my living room
Can't stop thinking 'bout you kissing her neck
Been going Jack Nicholson, crazy in my living room
Running like a movie ’round and 'round in my head
I been going Jack Nicholson, crazy in my living room
Can't stop thinking 'bout you kissing her neck
Been going Jack Nicholson, crazy in my living room
Running like a movie 'round and 'round in my head

When April showers, you wash her hair
She's got your heart inside her hands
As the water falls
I bet it's gonna wash out every thought you ever had of me
Every hour, I'm more aware
She's in your eyes, no underwear
As the water falls
I bet it's gonna wash out every thought you ever had of me

I been going Jack Nicholson, crazy in my living room
Going Jack, going Jack
I been going Jack Nicholson, crazy in my living room
Going Jack, going Jack
I bet it's gonna wash out every thought you ever had of me1EmbedLook At Me Now Lyrics
I was shuffling my iPod
A Case Of You came on
Reminds me of you
It hit like a hammer, now I'm pulling over my car
You're blurring the skyline
I'm struck by a blindside
Thing is that hindsight is a bitch when I've spent all this time tryna cut all my losses

Pack you in boxes
Sign it and dot it
Oh, I thought that I was safe
That I'd danced you all away in rounds
Thought I'd finally figured out
How to move alone
How to call somewhere a home without ya
But look at me, look at me, look at me now
I am missing you more than I should
Guess I'm not out of the woods
Yeah, mm-mm
I'm making a fool of myself
While you're happy with somebody else
Baby, oh, look at me, look at me, look at me now

I was faking a brave face when we met in the same place
Cold Harbour Lane, but you're giving sips of your whiskey to somebody new
See you trying to impress her
Got my heart in a blender
'Cause now it's not me that you wanna see in your t-shirts, so I'm
Tryna to cut all my losses

Pack them in boxes
Sign it and dot it
Oh, I thought that I was safe
That I'd danced you all away in rounds
Thought I'd finally figured out
How to move alone
How to call somewhere a home without ya
But look at me, look at me, look at me now
I am missing you more than I should
Guess I'm not out of the woods
Yeah, oh-oh-oh
I'm making a fool of myself
While you're happy with somebody else
Babe
Oh, look at me, look at me, look at me now

And I'm off the rails
Cigarettes when I don't smoke
I thought I had it
I, I thought I had it but I don't
Hail a taxi now
Give 'em your postcode
'Cause it's outta habit
I thought I had it but I don't
No, I don't
I thought that I was safe
That I'd danced you all away in rounds
Thought I'd finally figured out
How to move alone
How to call somewhere a home without ya
But look at me, look at me, look at me now
I am missing you more than I should
Guess I'm not out of the woods
Yeah, no
I'm making a fool of myself
While you're happy with somebody else
Baby
Oh, look at me, look at me, look at me now1EmbedPersonal Best Lyrics
August was two blue bikes
We don't use now you drive
Mm-mm
Apple juice to pink wine
Oh, what's yours is always mine
Mm-mm

And the months flew like swallows to sea
Now you're calling my phone instead of my street
Are you dancing whilst I am asleep?
Do you miss having me beside you?
In the front of your car on the way home
Speeding past Brighton, with our arms out to 'Halo'
And I'd walk into the wild if you'd say so
Oh, and that was then
Oh, and that was then
You're my favourite escape in the city
And I don't feel right unless you are here with me
All that we are is the greatest of victories
You're my per-er-ersonal best
My personal be-est

September was plastic bags
Cutlery and years we had
Mm-mm
Missing you when I walk
The party's over, can you talk?
Mm-mm

And the months flew like swallows to sea
Now you're calling my phone instead of my street
Are you dancing whilst I am asleep?
Do you miss having me beside you?
In the front of your car on the way home
Speeding past Brighton, with our arms out to 'Halo'
And I'd walk into the wild if you'd say so
Oh, and that was then
Oh, and that was then
You're my favourite escape in the city
And I don't feel right unless you are here with me
All that we are is the greatest of victories
You're my per-er-ersonal best
My personal be-est

Seven hours, longest drive
I wait for you station side
Heart is half 'til you say
"I missed you"2EmbedIn My Head Lyrics
Heartbreak Saturday nights, getting ready
To make you see that I'm better already
I put on every perfume
And I do it to hurt you
And, oh

Make sure I smell like your bedroom when I was in it
Wearing the dress that I met you and sent you spinning
And I flirt with your friends
But it’s a beggar's revenge
'Cause she’s with you again
And I try to look away
'Cause in my head, in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm yours, and I should know better, but I
Can't forget, oh, forget how it was before
Oh, it felt forever, baby
We should still be holding on
I should still put on your coat
And when the music dies out
You should still take me home
'Cause in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm yours still

This dress' too nice for a jacket, so I'm freezing
You’re walking past and on habit, I lean in
Close to your touch ’cause I still think we're an “us”
I know I should give it up
Oh

Feels like half of me’s missing
But there's no hope
You don't care who I'm kissing
When the lights go
Oh, I know, I know that you don’t
'Cause in my head, in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm yours, and I should know better, but I
Can't forget, oh, forget how it was before
Oh, it felt forever, baby
We should still be holding on
I should still put on your coat
And when the music dies out
You should still take me home
'Cause in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm yours
In my head, in my head, in my head
I'm yours

Oh, I'm still hurting and I'm still here
You're still not looking at me, my dear
I'll watch you leaving, I'll watch you go
And I'll say nothing
But we both know

In my head, in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm yours, mm
In my head, in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm yours2EmbedDetails Lyrics
One, two, three

I don't wanna know the details
Don't wanna know where she's from
Or the New Year's that you met her
Just wanna know where you've gone
I don't wanna have to meet her
Pretend we get along
Yeah, I know that's selfish and sudden and wrong
But I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause if I talk about it
Then you'll see I don't, I don't
Know what to do about it
What to do about this feeling that I don't want
But I'll keep it all to myself
If you spare me the details

I don't care about the mixtape
What kind of cigarettes she smokes
Don't wanna hear about the one time
You made up in that park we'd always go
So I'll ignore her and she'll be really nice to me
Yeah, I know I'm being bitter and jealous and mean

But I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause if I talk about it
Then you'll see I don't, no I don't
Know what to do about it
What to do about this feeling that I don't want
But I'll keep it all to myself
If you spare me the details
So you'll pull me over on a Friday night
Both a little drunk and you're asking why
I've been so off since late December
Say "I don't know, no I don't remember"
Look, I don't think I want you to myself
But I know I don't want you with anybody else
Don't think you want to hear that either

So let's not talk about it, let's not talk about it
'Cause then we won't, no we won't
Have to do something about it
Or just dance around it
Until we don't
So I'll keep it all to myself
If you'll keep it all to yourself
And just spare me the details

Details, details, details, details, details, details, details
Details, details, details, details, details3EmbedEnough for You Lyrics
I took it hard
Try not to fall apart
But I like your eyes with your glasses off
Lipstick so nice when it's twelve o'clock
'Cause I see you then
We talk about all my friends
And I wonder who you're going home to
Would you do all the things that he don't do?

'Cause you're one of a kind and you're stuck on my mind
It's an issue
'Cause I miss you
When I'm sat just watching TV
I spilled out my heart in the front of your car
Kind of funny
Now you don't wanna see me
And I get it, no, I really do
But I wish I was enough for you
You drive
Into car parks at four to five
And there's some other girl in your wing mirror
And that hole in my chest gets a bit bigger
And it dawns on me
All the things that I couldn't see
It was perfect as long as it wasn't real
But it was worth it to know how the films all feel

You're one of a kind
And you're stuck on my mind
It's an issue
'Cause I already miss you
When I'm sat just watching TV
I poured out my heart
In the front of your car
Kind of funny
Now you don't want to see me
And I get it, no, I really do
But I wish I was enough for you2EmbedArchitecture Lyrics
Cross-legged, sitting in your mum's kitchen
My word's missing, and I like the way you sing
And I like the way you think 'bout the weather forecast
'Cause this summer won't last
Ripped photographs, whisper secrets to the wind
This is a battle I won't win

You'll go and I'll know
I owe you all the love you showed me I deserved
The gold that I was worth
You built me up like architecture
Boy, you'll break my heart, I'll let ya
'Cause no one nowhere knows me better than you
Your bags are packed, my words are stacked
Towers of paperbacks with all that I won't say
The dreams we used to make
Now your train ticket takes my breath with it
But you're the biggest and the brightest that this place has ever made
And I can't ask you stay

You'll go and I'll know
I owe you all the love you showed me I deserved
The gold that I was worth
You built me up like architecture
Boy, you'll break my heart, I'll let ya
'Cause no one nowhere knows me better than you

You were borrowed, now I'm blue
Oh, nobody new could be better than you

You'll go and I'll know
That I owe you all the love you showed me I deserved
The gold that I was worth, oh
You'll go and I'll know
I owe you all the love you showed me I deserved
The gold that I was worth
You built me up like architecture
Boy, you'll break my heart, I'll let ya
'Cause no one nowhere knows me better than you2EmbedYou to You Lyrics
Two months ago today
You had my heart on a plate
We ate takeout on your floor
I gave the world to you and more
But it took you a minute to rip us up in a minute
To say you're done with committing

And I lost my friends
Took your side
Had your back ’cause I thought you had mine
That was then
I was wrong
So I hope that you find someone that you trust
And you give all your darkest secrets up
And then I hope she breaks your heart in two
Hope she does a you to you, to you, to you, to you, to you

I shouldn't be surprised
You're not the ’meet the parents' type
You said you needed me, you wanted to be with me
Just don't want your friends to see
You said I was different, but I wasn't different
And now I wish that I'd listened

And I lost my friends
Took your side
Had your back 'cause I thought you had mine
That was then
I was wrong

So I hope that you find someone that you trust
And you give all your darkest secrets up
And then I hope she breaks your heart in two
Hope she does a you to you, to you, to you, to you, to you
I hope you give her everything you've got
And she tells you you're special when you’re not
And then I hope she breaks your heart in two
Hope she does a you to you, to you, to you, to you, to you
I know this song is bitter but my calls didn’t get through to you
Blocked on both your phones, oh, look at that, I guess it's two for two
Calling me a psycho to our friends and that’s not news to me
Wish it was but honestly, it's just so you
So I hope you think you've finally found the one
And then she fucks you over just for fun
'Cause then maybe you’ll realize what you do
Hope she does a you to you

So I hope that you find someone that you trust (oh, you find, babe)
And you give all your darkest secrets up
And then I hope she breaks your heart in two (hope she does)
Hope she does a you to you, to you, to you, to you, to you

Oh, I hope she, yeah, I hope
I hope she breaks your heart
Baby, oh you know I hope she does
And I hope she does, I hope she does2EmbedFeels Like This Lyrics
Who cares 'bout star signs?
I’m hardwired to be with you
You're like a sunrise and I'm scared that I’ll never get enough of you
Nobody called it a starfall
Come out the blue

I'm all butterflies
I'm sky-high for you
When it feels like this, like a light came on
And you look at me like I'm all you want
I got everything at my fingertips
How can I resist when it feels like this?

Uncover secrets
Treasure hunting days away
Stumbling on diamonds
I'm speechless and blown away
The little things
I'm shivering
The way you hold my hand

I'm all butterflies
I'm sky-high for you

When it feels like this, like a light came on
And you look at me like I’m all you want
I got everything at my fingertips
How can I resist when it feels like this?

Like you were always meant to be
Right here next to me
In your faded denim jeans (when it feels like this)
Like we were always meant to be
To think I never knew it ’til now
When it feels like this, like a light came on
When you look at me like I'm all you want
I got everything at my fingertips
How can I resist?
When it feels like this, like a light came on
When you look at me, say I’m all you want
I got everything at my fingertips
How can I resist when it feels like this?2EmbedFeels Like Lyrics
Oh, we almost got away, we've cut it close
The city's getting loud
If I choke, it's only 'cause I'm scared to be alone
Been trying to work it out, you should know

I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like
Living in a movie I've watched and
Funny, 'cause you couldn't have called it (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like
Oh, the train was cold, we left Connecticut
We stayed a couple hours
Our clothes matched enough to throw me off a bit
Your phone was playing "Towers" and I

I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like
Living in a movie I've watched and
Funny, 'cause you couldn't have called it (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like

And I need you sometimes
We'll be alright (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like
And I miss you some nights
We'll be alright (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like
I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like3EmbedRockland Lyrics
Hey, I feel like I might say the wrong thing
I hung up when I started calling
You probably would've laughed then
If you had seen it happen
Hey, who took my place in bed when I left?
Who laughs at everything that you've said?
I'm sure that I would like her
If I were slightly nicer

Bet you wish you
Never even met me
I don't blame you
Broke your every heartbeat
Hey, I parked across the street from your house
The lights were on, the music got loud
I doubt you would've seen me
I hid from everybody
Hey, I feel like if we gave it one night
You'd hate me less and make it alright
Just wish that we could fight now
I'd hold you on the comedown

Bet you wish you
Never even met me
I don't blame you
Broke your every heartbeat
Bet you wish you
Never even met me
I can't blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipating every bad dream
Like falling with a knife, you cut deep
You cut deep, you cut deep
I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipating every bad dream
Like falling with a knife, you cut deep
You cut deep
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Bet you wish you
Never even met me
I don't blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

I see you every night in my sleep (Bet you wish you)
Anticipating every bad dream (Never even met me)
Like falling with a knife, you cut deep (I don't blame you)
You cut deep, you cut deep (Broke your every heartbeat)
I see you every night in my sleep (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Anticipating every bad dream (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Like falling with a knife, you cut deep (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You cut deep (Oh-oh, oh-oh)3EmbedFor Real This Time Lyrics
I think that maybe I was right
Back when I knew to draw the line
Already gave what I could offer
Maybe we'll work another time
I guess the thought of it's enough
No going back or switchin' up
I really wish that I could do that
Walking away from you is tough

I know we've run it dry
I've heard that happens sometimes
I shouldn't be surprised, should I?
I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times, I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong, but I think that I'm for real this time
I've taken down all the pictures in my room
I've hidden things that reminded me of you
I know I've lied, but I think that I'm for real this time

Couldn't you tell when I was off?
You never asked me what it was
I kind of hope you feel the same way
So that I'm not the only one

Who thinks we've run it dry?
But still we've stayed a long time
I'm sorry if I make you cry tonight

'Cause I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times, I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong, but I think that I'm for real this time
I've taken down all the pictures in my room
I've hidden things that reminded me of you
I know I've lied, but I think that I'm for real this time
I know that I've lied
But we're running dry
Know I won't come back this time
I know that I've lied
But we're runnin' dry
Think that I'm for real this time

I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times, I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong, but I think that I'm for real this time1EmbedCamden Lyrics
I never said it but I know that I
Can't picture anything past twenty-five
Not like I care to know the timing
Not like I'm looking for that silence
Self diagnosing 'til I'm borderline
I'll do whatever helps to sleep at night
Until I'm feeling like an island
Until I'm strong enough to hide it
What was I thinking looking for a sign?
As if I've ever seen the stars align
Somebody take over the driving
Somebody notice how I'm trying
Somebody notice how I'm trying
When I'm toeing that line all of the time
Calling it fine, calling it fine
Toeing that line all of the timе
Calling it fine, calling it fine

How do you call it when you'rе in your head?
Like when you really keep inside of it?
I only talk into the mirror
I'm only scared of getting bigger
At least I'll never turn to cigarettes
My brother shielded me from all of that
He said that smoking was a killer
He said he knows that I've been bitter
Maybe I'm waiting for the go ahead
The validation that I never get
Most of the game is unfamiliar
Most of the girls are getting thinner

Toeing that line all of the time
Calling it fine, calling it fine
Toein' that line all of the time
Calling it fine, calling it fine
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping

I never said it but I know that I
Can't picture anything past twenty-five
Not like I care to know the timing
Not like I'm looking for that silence
I never said it but I know that I
I bury baggage 'til it's out of sight
I think it's better if I hide it
I really hope that I survive this2EmbedThe Bottom Lyrics
I told you I was down bad
You hate to see me like that
I don't know how you look past
My stupid fucking setbacks

When you opened up the door
You let me in when you should have your guard up
What a painful back and forth, oh
It's hard to ignore all of my problems
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love, but this isn't falling
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom
'Cause I'm no good (Ooh), you could do better (Ooh)
You should walk out, it's now or never
I took the most (Ooh) that you could offer (Ooh)
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom (Ooh)

I told you I was down bad
You could never fix that
I'm happier when I'm sad
So leave and never come back

When you opened up the door
You let mе in when you should have your guard up
What a painful back and forth, oh

It's hard to ignore all of my problеms
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love, but this isn't falling
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom
'Cause I'm no good (Ooh), you could do better (Ooh)
You should walk out, it's now or never
I took the most (Ooh) that you could offer (Ooh)
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom (Ooh)
Watch me drag you down
No saving you now
Watch me drag you down
There's no getting out
Watch me drag you down
No saving you now
Watch me drag you down

It's hard to ignore (Ohh) all of my problems
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love, when this isn't falling (Ooh)
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom
'Cause I'm no good (Ooh), you could do better (Ooh)
You should walk out, it's now or never
I took the most (Ooh) that you could offer (Ooh)
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom (Ooh)EmbedWishful Thinking Lyrics
Meet you down at the bottom, finish a bottle
You know I know all your problems now
Flaked on me back in August
And if I'm honest, you've gotten harder to figure out

I know that you got everything you wanted
I heard a rumor, everybody's talking
About you now
I really thought that I could fix this, but nothing's different
How come I'm stuck on thinking you'd grow up? (You'd grow up)
I really hoped that we'd be past these problems, past tense
Is it just wishful thinking you'd grow up? (You'd grow up)

Dropped it all in a second after your message
Do you remember me calling out?
Meet you back in the wreckage, right where you left it
Do you regret how I see you now?

You said that you got better when you saw me
I heard a rumor, it's medicine and molly
You're blacking out

I really thought that I could fix this, but nothing's different
How come I'm stuck on thinking you'd grow up? (You'd grow up)
I really hoped that we'd be past these problems, past tense
Is it just wishful thinking you'd grow up? (You'd grow up)

You'd grow up, you'd grow up
You'd grow up, you'd grow up
You'd grow up, you'd grow up
You'd grow up, you'd grow up
You'd growEmbedOlder Lyrics
Pinch me now
You're caught in my crossfire
Fell into my arms, but they got tired
We were so good, weren't we?
'Til it just stopped working
Almost like we tore out the same page
And left a lot of room for new mistakes
You never quite let me in
When you felt cracks again
I stopped waving a flag
I just dropped all caring for that
I went quiet and you went cold
Guess that happened when we got older

Humour me
Could taking a break be the better thing?
Just letting each other breathe
Won't you just look at me? Or am I too draining?

You spent hours awake holding back
I know I'm to blame for the small talk
And tiptoeing over
Guess that happened when we got older

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

You spent hours awake holding back
I know I'm to blame for the small talk
And tiptoeing over
Guess that happened when we got older1EmbedBetter Lyrics
Don't feel it all, talk slow and leveled
Foot off the pedal
Same shirt and perfume on
The two of us were accidental
But so good together
Now all I feel is

So bad about it
I barely left my bed
We talk around it, all for nothing
So if that’s all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up, I hope
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that’s what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better

It's been a while
Old clothes fit larger
You're looking smaller
What happened when I left?

I'm not mad about it
But you've barely left my head
We talk around it, all for nothing

So if that's all it was
If you’re good giving in, giving up, I hope
So if that’s all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don’t wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better
I'd turn the car around if you'd let me
If you’d let me, you'd let me, you know
I'd cry my eyes out 'til I'm empty
'Til I'm empty, I'm empty, oh

So if that's all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up, I hope
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now

Hope you feel better now
Hope you feel betterEmbedHard To Sleep Lyrics
I only thought it for a minute, but it got me down
The kind of feeling when you've got something to cry about
And all the talking turned to screaming that I couldn't help
This isn't me, me, me
I only thought it for a moment but it's crippling
I guess the gravity of going out is sinking in
What if I'm missing the capacity for all of it?
This isn't me, me, me

And I'm so scared of losing all control
Don't you tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me
Audrey told me that she thinks it might be in my head
How I'm overthinking everything I never said
How it's killing me a little to be different, oh
It isn't me, me, me

But I'm so scared of losing all control
Don't you tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me

Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me? Only me
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me? Only me
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me? Only me
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me? Only me
Mm-mm, mm-hmm

I'm so scared of losing control
When they tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me
And I'm so scared of losing all control
When they tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world is so close
It's only me (Me), me (Me), me
It's only me, me, me2EmbedAugusta Lyrics
Feel like maybe I might go to Boston
Cut my hair in the way that I've wanted
Change my number and bury my wallet
California makes me exhausted

I'm lost
I'm lost

Heard a poem about mid-October
How the leaves in the fall feel like closure
About a girl that the guy wasn't over
Think that I might relate when I'm older
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost

Tough, I don't know a lot that could hurt me
Learned the hard way to forget my body
'Til you're walking around like a zombie
Still don't know how to talk through that story

I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lostEmbedPainkillers Lyrics
I almost liked the way you fooled me
To make me feel like this would last forever
But twice a night, I'd wake up sweating
To sleep without you here would do me better

I-I, I-I
Called you out and labeled you my problem
I-I, I-I
I should know that it takes one to know one
You represent the codependence
I was down, you wore the shining armor
The side-effect is cold resentment
Tricked mе into thinking you were stronger

I-I, I-I
Callеd you out and knew you were my problem
I-I, I-I
I should know that it takes one to know one

Hold me slowly
You don't even know me
Home now, lights out
Pictures just destroy me
Come through late, and
Tell me that you want it bad
Hold me slowly
You don't even know me
Home now, lights out
Pictures just destroy me
Come through late, and
Tell me that you want it bad1EmbedAlright Lyrics
I still avoid medication
I'd rather take a vacation
Drive around all of the outlets
Buy things and later regret it
Spend the whole week in Hawaii
Fall asleep under the palm trees
Down a whole bottle of whiskey
Counting the people who hate me

I don't know if I'll be alright
What will it take to make this good?
Oh, someone tell me it gets better, better, better, better
Because for tonight, I'm just not alright
What if I drove to you backwards?
Jump in the shallow end headfirst
Burn my emergency contact
Run for the hills when it gets bad
What if I never move out?
I'd live in the basement my whole life
I got the chills when I said that
I never thought of a fallback

I don't know if I'll be alright (Alright)
What will it take to make this good?
Oh, someone tell me it gets better, better, better, better
Because for tonight, I'm just not alright2EmbedFriend Lyrics
Pictures of the old us got me feelin' older
I just thought you should know I never wanted closure
But you had no problem leavin'
Now I'm the one to feel it

I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feeling
Guess you got the best of this
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killing me a little bit
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care
Funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be your friend?
I'm sure you're doin' fine but I don't wanna hear it
And if I left my T-shirt, you can keep it
I don't wanna see you again if it's different
'Cause I'll only see all the things that I'm missin'
And I should've cut all the ties but I didn't, I didn't let go, mmm

I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feeling
Guess you got the best of this (Guess you got the best of this)
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em

And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care (I still care)
Funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be...

You had no problem leavin'
Now, I'm the one to feel it

I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feeling
Guess you got the best of this (Guess you got the best of this)
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killing me a little bit (Killing me a little bit)
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care (I still care)
So funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be your friend8Embed21 Lyrics
I missed your 21st birthday
I've been up at home
Almost tried to call you, don't know if I should
Hate to picture you half-drunk happy
Hate to think you went out without me
I'm sorry if you blame me, if I were you, I would
Thought you'd see it coming, but you never could
I still haven't heard from your family
But you said your mom always loved me
Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white, I couldn't stay forever

I see the look in your eye and I'm biting my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under
I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
I'll be the love of your life inside your head
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under

Audrey said she saw you out past twelve o'clock
Just because you're hurting doesn't mean I'm not
If it doesn't go away by the time I turn thirty
I made a mistake and I'll tell you I'm sorry
"Sorry"

Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white, I couldn't stay forever
I see the look in your eye and I'm biting my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under
I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
I'll be the love of your life inside your head
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under11EmbedUnder / Over Lyrics
Funny when I think about the months that I could not get out of bed
Going back and forth over the letters that I wrote but never sent
Wake up and repeat it, but I was barely sleeping
Swimming in the memories, I'm floating in the deep end
How come you're not still in my head?

I got, you got, we got too much time on our hands
Used to be so caught up in the things we had planned
I'm not chasing feelings that I don't understand
I'm underwater, but I'm over you
Thought that I'd be good the day I took down all your pictures in my room
How'd it go from easier to everything's still leading back to you?
Can I be honest? I think about you constantly
You're closing every door, but now I'm looking for an opening
Maybe I'm just getting confused

I got, you got, we got too much time on our hands
Used to be so caught up in the things we had planned
I'm still chasing feelings that I don't understand
I'm underwater, am I over you?6Embed​tehe Lyrics
We played grown-up, drowned in bathtubs
But you never opened up and I never said enough
Thunder warnin' should've called it
But we never gave it up

Now I know it wasn't right, wasn't right
We pretended to hold it when quiet
And we blamed it on the time, on the time, on the time
And we broke it when silent
Slept on floors of, angry mornings
But you never let me in, so I stopped wanting it

Tearing every wall and breaking down the doors
Kept bending every rule 'til all of me was yours
And pushing things aside, but nothing ever worked, worked

Now I know it wasn't right, wasn't right
We pretended to hold it when quiet
And we blamed it on the time, on the time, on the time
And we broke it when silent

Tearing every wall and breaking down the doors
Kept bending every rule 'til all of me was yours
And pushing things aside, but nothing ever worked, worked

Now I know it wasn't right, wasn't right
We pretended to hold it when quiet
And we blamed it on the time, on the time, on the time
And we broke it when silent2EmbedI miss you, I’m sorry Lyrics
Do you remember happy together?
I do, don't you?
Then all of a sudden, you're sick to your stomach
Is that still true?

You said, "forever," in the end I fought it
Please be honest, are we better for it?
Thought you'd hate me, but instead you called
And said, "I miss you"
I caught it
Good to each other, give it the summer
I knew, you too
But I only saw you once in December
I'm still confused

You said, "forever," and I almost bought it
I miss fighting in your old apartment
Breaking dishes when you're disappointed
I still love you, I promise
Nothing happened in the way I wanted
Every corner of this house is haunted
And I know you said that we're not talking
But I miss you, I'm sorry

I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us
I don't wanna go, we've been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you (You said, "forever," and I almost bought it)
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (I miss fighting in your old apartment)
Everything I know brings me back to us (Breaking dishes when you're disappointed)
I don't wanna go, we've been here before (I still love you, I promise)
Everywhere I go leads me back to you (Nothing happened in the way I wanted)
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (Every corner of this house is haunted)
Everything I know brings me back to us (And I know you said that we're not talking)
I don't wanna go, we've been here before (But I miss you)
Everywhere I go leads me back to you
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us
I don't wanna go, we've been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you28EmbedLong Sleeves Lyrics
Packing while you're asleep
You were the catalyst
I don't know what it is about how you breathe
About how you breathe
I want to be alone
Hate it that no one knows, you're good to everyone
All them but me
All them but me

And if you hear me leaving in the morning
Could you just pretend that it was only wind?
'Cause I can't love you even if I want to
Got a lot to work through
You don't know where I've been
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming

Say something sweet to me
It never meant a thing
Used to the turbulence
I wore long sleeves
I wore long sleeves
Fought 'til you tethered me
Swept under surfaces
Never enough of it
You didn't think
You didn't think

If you hear me leaving in the morning
Could you please pretend that it was only wind?
'Cause I can't love you even if I want to
Got a lot to work through
You don't know where I've been

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming
Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down4Embed​minor Lyrics
Hit me 310
And I'll be home at some point
Past sundown, because traffic
You already know that, oh
I'll put on a show
If you just come over
I'm sorry your house is in Glendale
Or somewhere far

I would drive all night to get to you
But my curfew is early and moms up at home
I would run for miles to get to you
But you gotta understand I can't 'cause
M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck, oh

Hit me 310
We'll meet by the freeway
It's shady, but better than nothing
Oh, take my word
I grew up not far but never been down here
At this time your house is in Glendale
Or somewhere far

I would drive all night to get to you
But my curfew is early and dad's at the door
I would run for miles to get to you
But you gotta understand I can't 'cause

M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck, oh
M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck, oh10Embed
